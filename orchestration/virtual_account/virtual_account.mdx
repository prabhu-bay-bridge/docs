title: "Virtual Accounts"

# Overview

Bridge **virtual accounts are permanent, reusable fiat deposit addresses** that convert incoming fiat into crypto and deliver it to your specified destination (e.g. a wallet address).

They support multiple currencies and provide customers with local deposit details like account numbers and routing codes. For example, a USD virtual account gives your customer a U.S. account and routing number for ACH or wire transfers.

**Supported Payment Rails**

- **USD Virtual Accounts** - U.S. bank account and routing numbers issued in your customerâ€™s name.
- **SEPA Virtual IBAN** - Euro-denominated IBANs for accepting SEPA payments.
- **MXN Virtual Accounts** - CLABE account numbers for receiving SPEI (Mexico) payments.

Developers use virtual accounts to simplify global payments, custody stablecoins (e.g. USDB), and enable programmable flows. A common pattern: create a virtual account for a customer, route funds into a Bridge wallet, and earn yield.

<Note>
  **Customers must be onboarded** and KYC/KYB-approved before creating virtual accounts.

# Creating virtual accounts

Use the Virtual Accounts API to provision permanent fiat deposit addresses for your customers. You define the `source` currency for the account and configure the `destination` to specify where Bridge should deliver the converted funds.

Bridge handles the fiat-to-crypto conversion and sends the funds on-chain automatically.

## Sharing Deposit Instructions

Once a Virtual Account is created, use the `source_deposit_instructions` object in the response to share the fiat deposit details with your customer. Funds sent to those details will be automatically converted and delivered to the crypto destination you specified.

## **Optional Blockchain memo**

For memo-based blockchains such as Stellar, you may include an optional `blockchain_memo` in the destination. Bridge will attach the memo to payments sent to the destination address.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/customers/cust_alice/virtual_accounts' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Api-Key: <Api-Key>' \
--header 'Idempotency-Key: <Unique Idempotency Key>' \
--data-raw '{
  "source": {
    "currency": "usd",
  },
  "destination": {
    "payment_rail": "stellar",
    "currency": "usdc",
    "address": "STELLARADDRESS",
    "blockchain_memo": "STELLARBLOCKCHAINMEMO"
  }
}'
```

# **Amounts**

- `amount`- For transaction-related events in the destination currency (`payment_processed`, `payment_submitted`), this amount is the final total amount of funds sent to the destination. For all other events, which use the source currency, this is the initial amount received from the source.
- `subtotal_amount`- The amount of funds received from the source minus any fiat fees: developer fee and exchange fee. This is always in the source currency.

Refer [<u>here</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/docs/transaction-costs) on minimum amounts for transactions.

## **Developer Fees**

Refer [<u>Developer Fees</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/docs/developer-fees)<u> [todo update link]</u>

## **Other Fees**

- `exchange_fee_amount`- The fee for exchanging one currency to another, in the source currency. This may be 0.
- `gas_fee`- The fee for sending funds on chain, in the destination currency. This is usually 0 for most currencies and chains.
