### **Optional Blockchain memo**

For memo-based blockchains such as Stellar, you may include an optional `blockchain_memo` in the destination. Bridge will attach the memo to payments sent to the destination address.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/customers/cust_alice/virtual_accounts' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Api-Key: <Api-Key>' \
--header 'Idempotency-Key: <Unique Idempotency Key>' \
--data-raw '{
  "source": {
    "currency": "usd",
  },
  "destination": {
    "payment_rail": "stellar",
    "currency": "usdc",
    "address": "STELLARADDRESS",
    "blockchain_memo": "STELLARBLOCKCHAINMEMO"
  }
}'
```

# **Amounts**

- `amount`- For transaction-related events in the destination currency (`payment_processed`, `payment_submitted`), this amount is the final total amount of funds sent to the destination. For all other events, which use the source currency, this is the initial amount received from the source.
- `subtotal_amount`- The amount of funds received from the source minus any fiat fees: developer fee and exchange fee. This is always in the source currency.

Refer [<u>here</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/docs/transaction-costs) on minimum amounts for transactions.

## **Developer Fees**

Refer [<u>Developer Fees</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/docs/developer-fees)

## **Other Fees**

- `exchange_fee_amount`- The fee for exchanging one currency to another, in the source currency. This may be 0.
- `gas_fee`- The fee for sending funds on chain, in the destination currency. This is usually 0 for most currencies and chains.
