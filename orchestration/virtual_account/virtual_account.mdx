## **Event Details**

### **Event Types**

#### **Transaction Status Events**

`funds_received` - This is an acknowledgment that Bridge has received funds and is in the process of moving funds on the customer's behalf.\
`payment_submitted` - This means Bridge has sent the payment and is currently awaiting verification. This usually takes just a few minutes to confirm the crypto transaction on chain\
`payment_processed` - The transaction has been completed. The funds have arrived at your specified destination. This is a terminal state.

Please note that a transaction will always progress from `funds_received` → `payment_submitted` → `payment_processed`. It can never go backwards.

`funds_scheduled` - The events provides a notification that incoming funds are processing through an external system and an estimated arrival date for the credit. This event does not occur for all payments. Only ACH transactions can trigger a `funds_scheduled` event.

`in_review` - A temporary state triggered when a transaction is undergoing review. Bridge may reach out to collect more information before progressing the transaction.

`refunded` - If Bridge is unable to complete the transaction and needs to return the funds to the sender, this event will be triggered.

#### **Non-transactional Events**

`microdeposit` - These events are triggered when a sending bank initiates a microdeposit verification process. This is the only event emitted for this verification process. These funds are never onramped and don't go through the transaction statuses above.

`account_update` - Triggered when the details of a Virtual Account (e.g. destination currency or address) are changed.

`deactivation` - This event is fired when a Virtual Account is deactivated which prevents it from accepting any incoming transactions

`reactivation` - Triggered if a previously deactivated account is later reactivated.

### **Deposit ID**

All transaction-triggered events include a `deposit_id` field. This id is unique for each transaction that Bridge receives through this Virtual Account and can be used to link separate events to the same source transaction.

### **Funds Received Events**

Information about a fiat deposit received. The `funds_received` event amount always matches the full amount that the customer sent before any fees are deducted. We also provide any source information we have about the sender of a deposit.

- `payment_rail`- `ach_push` or `wire`. The payment rail on which the deposit was received. Different information is available for each of these payment rail types.
- For ACH deposits, funding events have these details:
  - `description`- This field contains the sender-related information set by the sending bank according to the NACHA ACH file specifications;
  - `sender_routing_number`- The routing number of the entity that initiated this ACH transaction
  - `sender_name`- The name of the business or individual who initiated the ACH as provided through the ACH system
  - `trace_number`- The unique, a 15-digit number associated with each ACH transaction that is used for tracking and reconciling transactions
- For wire deposits, funding events have these details:
  - `bank_routing_number` - The routing number of the bank which sent this wire
  - `bank_name` - The name of the bank which sent this wire
  - `bank_beneficiary_name` - The name the sender used for the beneficiary name of the wire
  - `originator_name`- The name of the sender
  - `originator_address` - The address of the sender
  - `imad` - A unique number given to each FedWire payment when using the Federal Reserve Bank Service which can be used to investigate and track wire transfers.

  }
}
```

### **Payment Submitted Events**

Information about any funds sent on chain using the deposit instructions. This event is created when the funds are sent on chain. The `payment_submitted` event amount is the funds sent to the destination after all fees are taken out and includes a breakdown of the amount of each fee. Some information such as `destination_tx_hash` may not be available immediately after the event is created but will be populated later when the transaction is confirmed on chain.

For convenience, the source deposit information is included in this event as well if available.

### **Payment Processed Events**

Information about any funds sent on chain using the deposit instructions. This event is created when the funds are confirmed on chain. The `payment_processed` event amount is the funds sent to the destination after all fees are taken out and includes a breakdown of the amount of each fee. The`destination_tx_hash`will always be populated for these events. This is final event in the onramp payment lifecycle and the best event to determine when a payment is fully complete.

For convenience, the source deposit information is included in this event as well if available.

### **Bank Verification Events**

> ## **📘Virtual Accounts support microdeposit and challenge deposit verification to help your customers link external bank accounts.**

When a customer links their Virtual Account with another financial platform (e.g. a fintech app or payroll provider), they may be prompted to verify ownership through one of two methods:

- **Microdeposit Verification** – A small amount (typically less than \$1) is deposited and withdrawn to confirm the account is active.
- **Challenge Deposit Verification **– One or more microdeposits are made, and the customer must input the exact deposit amounts (e.g. \$0.56 and \$0.84) to pass verification.

Bridge supports both of these methods by allowing microdebits and credits to pass through. Please note:

- **Microdeposits are never onramped **– Any deposit under \$1 is treated as a verification attempt and will not trigger a payment or transfer.
- **Only Virtual Accounts support verification** – Static memo-based deposit flows (e.g. with shared memos) are not compatible with microdeposit verification

We automatically generate a `microdeposit` event for each verification attempt. This event includes the amount, source bank details, and timestamp—so you can display them to the customer for verification if needed.

❗**Credit and debit entries (positive and negative amounts)** may both appear during the verification process. However, some providers may only send a credit—behavior varies by the verifying institution.

### **Account Update Events**

If a Virtual Account is modified using the [<u>Update a Virtual Account</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/reference/put_customers-customerid-virtual-accounts-virtualaccountid) endpoint, its history will include an `account_update` event to track what changed. The `account_updates` field in this event will contain a map of fields with their previous and updated values.

JSON

```
{
  "id": "va_event_456",
  "customer_id": "cust_alice",
  "virtual_account_id": "va_123",
  "type": "account_update",
  "amount": "0.0",
  "currency": "usd",
  "created_at": "2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "account_updates": {
    "destination_currency": ["usdc", "usdt"],
  }
```

# **Amounts**

- `amount`- For transaction-related events in the destination currency (`payment_processed`, `payment_submitted`), this amount is the final total amount of funds sent to the destination. For all other events, which use the source currency, this is the initial amount received from the source.
- `subtotal_amount`- The amount of funds received from the source minus any fiat fees: developer fee and exchange fee. This is always in the source currency.

Refer [<u>here</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/docs/transaction-costs) on minimum amounts for transactions.

## **Developer Fees**

Refer [<u>Developer Fees</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/docs/developer-fees)

## **Other Fees**

- `exchange_fee_amount`- The fee for exchanging one currency to another, in the source currency. This may be 0.
- `gas_fee`- The fee for sending funds on chain, in the destination currency. This is usually 0 for most currencies and chains.
