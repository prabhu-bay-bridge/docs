## **What is a virtual account event?**

Whenever a deposit is received, Bridge generates a `VirtualAccountEvent` with a unique `id`. You can:

- Fetch historical events using the [Virtual Account Activity API](/api-reference/virtual-accounts/virtual-account-activity).
- Receive **real-time webhook notifications** when:
  - A new deposit is received.
  - The status of an event changes (e.g. funds delivered, refund issued).

Each `VirtualAccountEvent` includes detailed information about the deposit, source, status, and destination.

## **Event Types**

Below are the different types of virtual account events you may receive. You can identify the type of each event by checking the `type` field in the virtual account event object.

| Type                | Description                                                           |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `funds_received`    | Bridge received funds via ACH or wire.                                |
| `payment_submitted` | Bridge submitted the crypto payment.                                  |
| `payment_processed` | Payment confirmed on-chain. Final state.                              |
| `funds_scheduled`   | (ACH only) Incoming funds are in transit with estimated arrival date. |
| `in_review`         | Transaction is under manual review.                                   |
| `refunded`          | Funds could not be delivered and were refunded to the sender.         |
| `account_update`    | Virtual Account was updated (e.g. new destination address).           |
| `deactivation`      | Virtual Account was deactivated.                                      |
| `reactivation`      | Virtual Account was reactivated.                                      |
| `microdeposit`      | Microdeposit verification detected. Funds are never onramped.         |

<Tip>
  **Deposit ID**\
  \
  All transaction-triggered events include a `deposit_id` field. This id is unique for each transaction that Bridge receives through this Virtual Account and can be used to link separate events to the same source transaction.

## **Event Breakdown**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Funds received" description="Bridge received funds via ACH or wire.">
    Information about a fiat deposit received. The `funds_received` event amount always matches the full amount that the customer sent before any fees are deducted. We also provide any source information we have about the sender of a deposit.

    - `payment_rail`- `ach_push` or `wire`. The payment rail on which the deposit was received. Different information is available for each of these payment rail types.
    - For ACH deposits, funding events have these details:
      - `description`- This field contains the sender-related information set by the sending bank according to the NACHA ACH file specifications;
      - `sender_routing_number`- The routing number of the entity that initiated this ACH transaction
      - `sender_name`- The name of the business or individual who initiated the ACH as provided through the ACH system
      - `trace_number`- The unique, a 15-digit number associated with each ACH transaction that is used for tracking and reconciling transactions
    - For wire deposits, funding events have these details:
      - `bank_routing_number` - The routing number of the bank which sent this wire
      - `bank_name` - The name of the bank which sent this wire
      - `bank_beneficiary_name` - The name the sender used for the beneficiary name of the wire
      - `originator_name`- The name of the sender
      - `originator_address` - The address of the sender
      - `imad` - A unique number given to each FedWire payment when using the Federal Reserve Bank Service which can be used to investigate and track wire transfers.

  <Accordion title="Bank verification">
    <Info>
      **Virtual Accounts support microdeposit and challenge deposit verification** to help your customers link external bank accounts.
    </Info>
    When a customer links their Virtual Account with another financial platform (e.g. a fintech app or payroll provider), they may be prompted to verify ownership through one of two methods:

    - **Microdeposit Verification** – A small amount (typically less than \$1) is deposited and withdrawn to confirm the account is active.
    - \*\*Challenge deposit verification \*\*– One or more microdeposits are made, and the customer must input the exact deposit amounts (e.g. \$0.56 and \$0.84) to pass verification.

    Bridge supports both of these methods by allowing microdebits and credits to pass through. Please note:

    - **Microdeposits are never onramped** – Any deposit under \$1 is treated as a verification attempt and will not trigger a payment or transfer.
    - **Only Virtual Accounts support verification** – Static memo-based deposit flows (e.g. with shared memos) are not compatible with microdeposit verification

    We automatically generate a `microdeposit` event for each verification attempt. This event includes the amount, source bank details, and timestamp—so you can display them to the customer for verification if needed.

    <Note>
      **Credit and debit entries (positive and negative amounts)** may both appear during the verification process. However, some providers may only send a credit—behavior varies by the verifying institution.
