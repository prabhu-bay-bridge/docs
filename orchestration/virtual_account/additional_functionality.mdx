# **Update a Virtual Account**

Update the destination details for an existing Virtual Account. Future transactions will use the updated destination details. All fields in this request are optional. Updating a Virtual Account will also create an `account_update` event in the history for that account.

```bash
curl --location --request PUT 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/customers/cust_alice/virtual_accounts/va_123' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Api-Key: <Api-Key>' \
  --data-raw '{
	  "destination": {
	    "payment_rail": "ethereum",
	    "currency": "usdt",
	    "address": "0xDEADBEEF"
	  },
    "developer_fee_percent": "2.5", // 2.5%, omitting will not change the existing dev fee percent
  }'
```

# **Deactivate a Virtual Account**

This endpoints provide a history of activity for a Virtual Account such incoming funds received and outgoing payments submitted.
