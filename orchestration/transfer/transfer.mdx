## **Overview**

The Transfer API enables seamless conversion **to and from fiat and crypto across various supported currencies and rails.** At its core, the API is designed to abstract away the complexity of cross-rail and cross-currency money movement, supporting:

- Fiat → Crypto
- Crypto → Crypto
- Crypto → Fiat

Transfers include both a source and a destination, each of which can represent fiat sources or blockchain-based wallets. The API is generalized, composable, and rails-agnostic, allowing for a variety of transfer flows that suit modern financial applications.

Refer to supported currencies and rails below:

- [Stablecoins and Blockchains](/whatwesupport/chains)
- [Fiat Payment Methods](/whatwesupport/fiats)

### **How transfers work**

Depending on the source, Bridge either pulls funds (e.g. Bridge wallet, prefunded account) or generates deposit instructions when a third-party source (e.g. bank, external wallet) is specified.

If the funds reside outside of Bridge, you will receive a `source_deposit_instructions` object in the response payload containing deposit bank details or blockchain addresses. Once your customer completes the deposit, Bridge will automatically detect and process the payment to the destination.

### **Key Concepts**

- `source`: Where the funds come from. This can be a Bridge-controlled wallet, a customer’s crypto wallet, or a fiat source like a bank account.
- `destination`: Where the funds go. This can be any supported rail or chain.
- `on_behalf_of`: Customer identifier. Required when sending/receiving on behalf of a user.
- `developer_fee` or `developer_fee_percent`: Monetize transfers via fixed or percentage fees. Refer the [Developer Fees](/fees/devfees) section on how to set fees.
- `features`: Optional settings to add flexibility (e.g. allow_any_from_address, flexible_amount).

## **High Level Flow**

For one time transfers, the high level flow is:

1. You, the developer, will create a transfer specifying the `source` and `destination`
   1. If the source is a pre-funded account or a bridge wallet, Bridge will pull funds directly from it and skip the above steps -- there is no deposit required.
2. Bridge will create a transfer object which will include `source_deposit_instructions`.
3. You will instruct your customer to follow the `source_deposit_instructions`.
4. Your customer will send a deposit following the `source_deposit_instructions`.
5. Bridge will **_match_** your customer's deposit to the transfer you created.
6. Bridge sends money to the `destination`.

### **Create Transfer**

### **Deposit Instructions**

**Fiat Deposits**

```json expandable
{
  ...
"source_deposit_instructions": {
    "bank_account_number": "123456789", # Bridge's bank account number to send deposits to
    "bank_routing_number": "101019644", # Bridge's bank account routing number
 		# if the transfer requires a specific amount, it's important your customer includes
    # the exact amount expected.
    "amount": "10.0", 
    "currency": "usd",
    "deposit_message": "BVI7depositmessage", # important that the deposit message is included
  },
   ...
}
```

<Warning>
  **Unique Deposit Message**

  Due to the limitations of fiat rails, we will create a unique identifier for your customer to attach to the deposit they send to Bridge. We rely on that identifier to match customer deposits to your transfer.
</Warning>

Direct your customer to send funds to Bridge's bank account, with the required amount and currency, and to include the deposit message (starting with BRG). Your customer can include the unique deposit message as the wire memo/message, ACH push description, SEPA reference, or SPEI memo. The deposit message is unique per transfer and including it with your transaction is required for Bridge to process.

**Crypto Deposits**

If you receive crypto deposits, remember to configure a crypto return policy\! Refer [Crypto Return Policies](/orchestration/transfer/returns#returning-crypto-deposits)

```json expandable
{
  ...
  "source_deposit_instructions": {
    "payment_rail": "ethereum", # expected blockchain
    "amount": "10.0", # expected amount
    "currency": "usdc", # expected currency
    "from_address": "0xdeadbeef", # expected address for funds to originate from
    "to_address": "0xc0ffee" # Bridge's deposit address to send funds to
  },
   ...
}
```

In this instance, we need to request your customer to deposit funds to Bridge from their wallet. The `source_deposit_instructions` object in the response will contain Bridge's deposit address.

You can guide your user to use Metamask or an equivalent wallet to create a blockchain transfer to move funds from their wallet to our deposit address.

**Memo Based Blockchains**

```json expandable
{
  ...
  "source_deposit_instructions": {
    "payment_rail": "stellar",
    "amount": "10.0",
    "currency": "usdc",
    "from_address": "GDUY7JALICESTELLARADDRESS",
    "to_address": "GDUY7JSBRIDGESTELLARDEPOSITADDRESS",
    "blockchain_memo": "123456",
  },
  ...
}
```

For memo-based blockchains, such as Stellar and Tron, a `blockchain_memo` will be provided as part of the `source_deposit_instructions` in the response.

<Warning>
  **This must be included in the crypto deposit memo.** When you forget to include the memo, your off-ramp will experience signficant delays
</Warning>

### **Transfer Delivery**

Once we receive the deposit for your transfer, we will move the funds to the destination. You can use the Transfers API to check the state of the transfer or listen to webhooks.
