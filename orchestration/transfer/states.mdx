title: "Transfer States"
---

The transfer status refers to the current state of a transfer. There are several possible states that a transfer can be in, including:

| **Status**          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                   |
| :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `awaiting_funds`    | Bridge is waiting to receive funds from the customer before processing the transfer. This applies to incoming crypto deposits, wires, or ACH pushes.              |
| `in_review`         | A rare, temporary state triggered when transfer data needs further confirmation. Typically resolves in seconds; otherwise, Bridge will reach out within 24 hours. |
| `funds_received`    | Bridge has received the funds and is preparing to move them on the customer’s behalf.                                                                             |
| `payment_submitted` | Bridge has initiated the payment and is awaiting confirmation. Time to completion depends on the payment rail: minutes (Crypto), hours (Wires), or days (ACH).    |
| `payment_processed` | The transfer is complete and funds have been successfully delivered to the destination.                                                                           |
| `undeliverable`     | Bridge was unable to deliver funds due to an issue like an invalid account or unsupported asset at the destination.                                               |
| `returned`          | The payment was sent but failed. Funds have returned to Bridge and a refund to the sender is underway.                                                            |
| `refunded`          | The transfer was refunded back to the original sender.                                                                                                            |
| `canceled`          | The transfer was canceled. This can only happen from the `awaiting_funds` state via the DELETE `/v0/transfers/{transferID}` endpoint.                             |
| `error`             | A problem occurred that blocked processing. This typically requires manual review or developer action.                                                            |

Please note that a transfer will always progress from `awaiting_funds` → `funds_received` → `payment_submitted` → `payment_processed`. It can never go backwards.

`canceled` can only be progressed to from `awaiting_funds`, and is done by hitting our [<u>DELETE </u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/reference/delete_transfers-transferid)`/v0/transfers/{transferID}` endpoint.

Other states like `returned`, `refunded`, `undeliverable`, or `error` indicate exception paths.
