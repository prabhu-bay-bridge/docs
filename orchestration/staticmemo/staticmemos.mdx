# Create aÂ Static Memo

> ## **ðŸš§Deposit Message**
>
> For Static Memos, it is very important that the customer includes the `deposit_message` when they send funds. Failure to include the `deposit_message` will result in a significant delay in processing or a return of the funds.

Static Memos are long-lived deposit instructions that accept fiat funds through wire and ACH push and send funds to the configured destination wallet. The same Static Memo can receive both wires and ACH pushes interchangeably.

## **Event Details**

### **Event Types**

#### **Transaction Status Events**

`funds_received` - This is an acknowledgment that Bridge has received funds and is in the process of moving funds on the customer's behalf.\
`payment_submitted` - This means Bridge has sent the payment and is currently awaiting verification. This usually takes just a few minutes to confirm the crypto transaction on chain\
`payment_processed` - The transaction has been completed. The funds have arrived at your specified destination. This is a terminal state.

Please note that a transaction will always progress from `funds_received` â†’ `payment_submitted` â†’ `payment_processed`. It can never go backwards.

`in_review` - A temporary state triggered when a transaction is undergoing review. Bridge may reach out to collect more information before progressing the transaction.

`refund` - If Bridge is unable to complete the transaction and needs to return the funds to the sender, this event will be triggered.

#### **Non-transactional Events**

`account_update` - Triggered when the details of a Virtual Account (e.g. destination currency or address) are changed.

### **Deposit ID**

All transaction-triggered events include a `deposit_id` field. This id is unique for each transaction that Bridge receives through this Static Memo and can be used to link separate events to the same source transaction.

### **Funds Received Events**

Information about a fiat deposit received. The `funds_received` event amount always matches the full amount that the customer sent before any fees are deducted. We also provide any source information we have about the sender of a deposit. The information available differs by source payment rail:

- **ACH:** description, payment rail
- **Wire:** beneficiary name, routing number, bank name, IMAD, OMAD (deprecated), payment rail

Example Event

JSON

```
{
  "id": "sm_event_457",

  "static_memo_id": "sm_123",

    "omad": "20240110FIUGEYGYG03151101101621",
  }
}
```

### **Payment Submitted Events**

Information about any funds sent on chain using the deposit instructions. This event is created when the funds are sent on chain. The `payment_submitted` event amount is the funds sent to the destination after all fees are taken out and includes a breakdown of the amount of each customer-facing fee. Some information such as `destination_tx_hash` may not be available immediately after the `payment_submitted` event is created but will be populated later when the transaction is confirmed on chain.

For convenience, the source deposit information is included in this event as well if available.

Example Event

JSON

```
{
  "id": "sm_event_456",
  "customer_id": "cust_alice",
  "static_memo_id": "sm_123",

    "omad": "20240110FIUGEYGYG03151101101621",
  }
}
```

### **Payment Processed Events**

Information about any funds sent on chain using the deposit instructions. This event is created when the funds are confirmed on chain. The `payment_processed` event amount is the funds sent to the destination after all fees are taken out and includes a breakdown of the amount of each fee. The`destination_tx_hash`will always be populated for these events. This is final event in the onramp payment lifecycle and the best event to determine when a payment is fully complete.

For convenience, the source deposit information is included in this event as well if available.

Example event:

JSON

```
{
  "id": "sm_event_456",

    "omad": "20240110FIUGEYGYG03151101101621",
  }
}
```

### **In Review Events**

This event happens when a transaction enters the manual review queue. Bridge may reach out to obtain more information about the transaction before processing.

JSON

```

    "sender_bank_routing_number": "The routing number of the entity who sent this ACH transaction"
  }
}
```

### **Account Update Events**

If a Static Memo is modified using the [<u>Update a Static Memo</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/reference/put_customers-customerid-static-memos-staticmemoid) endpoint, its history will include an `account_update` event to track what changed. The `account_updates` field in this event will contain a map of fields with their previous and updated values.

JSON

```
{
  "id": "sm_event_456",
  "customer_id": "cust_alice",
  "static_memo_id": "sm_123",
  "type": "account_update",
  "amount": "0.0",

    "destination_currency": ["usdc", "usdt"],
  }
```

# **Microdeposits**

Static memos do not support microdeposit verifications.

# **Minimum Amounts**

The following destination currencies require a minimum amount of funds to complete an onramp:

- **USDT:** minimum of \$20 USD
- All others: \$1

# **Developer Fees**

Because the amount of funds sent isnâ€™t known ahead of time, Static Memos use a percentage rate to calculate developer fees.

- The fee is always in the source currency.
- The fee must be less than the customer's transaction amount.
- The fee has maximum 5 digits of precision, i.e.Â `0.00119`Â is allowed, butÂ `0.0000001`Â is not
- The fee is optional. IfÂ `developer_fee_percent`Â is blank, then itâ€™s equivalent to the fee being set toÂ `0.0`
- The fee is only valid on transactions where funds are transferred by Bridge (not to Bridge)
