title: "Drains"
---

A liquidation address automatically drains any funds sent to it and distributes those funds as the liquidation address is configured. Each time the address is drained, this creates a drain record.

# Fetching drain history

Example request to fetch the drain history of your liquidation address:

```bash Request
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/customers/cust_123/liquidation_addresses/addr_123/drains' \
     --header 'Api-Key: <Api-Key>' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```

```json Response

# **Additional Fields**

## **Destination**

The `destination` field will also return additional information when available. This information will be available when the transaction has been fully processed. The information available depends on the destination configuration of the Liquidation Address.

For wires:

```json
{
  "destination": {
    "payment_rail": "wire",
    "currency": "usd",
    "external_account_id": "310f23a7-9d15-4a67-b96f-bfe2acf26b00",
    "imad": "20240701MMASDFO9000528"
  }
}
```

For ACH:

```json
{
  "destination": {
    "payment_rail": "ach",
    "currency": "usd",
    "external_account_id": "310f23a7-9d15-4a67-b96f-bfe2acf26b00",
    "trace_number": "718268532664263"
  }
}
```

# **Drain States**

The drain state refers to the current state of a drain. 

| **State**           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `in_review`         | A temporary state that is rarely triggered. Typically resolves automatically within seconds. If unconfirmed after 24 hours, Bridge will contact the developer with next steps.                                           |
| `funds_received`    | Acknowledges that Bridge has received your funds and is now processing them on your customer's behalf.                                                                                                                   |
| `payment_submitted` | Indicates that Bridge has sent the payment and is awaiting verification. Timing varies by rail: minutes (Crypto), hours (Wires), or days (ACH Push).                                                                     |
| `payment_processed` | The payment has been successfully completed. Funds have reached the destination. Depending on configuration, metadata such as `destination_tx_hash` (on-chain), `imad` (wires), or `trace_number` (ACH) may be included. |
| `undeliverable`     | Bridge was unable to send the funds. Common reasons include invalid routing/account numbers or unsupported asset types at the destination.                                                                               |
| `returned`          | The payment was sent but failed, and the funds have been returned to Bridge.                                                                                                                                             |
| `refunded`          | Funds that were returned have been delivered to the configured crypto return address destination (learn more [here](/orchestration/transfer/returns)).                                                                   |
| `error`             | A problem prevented Bridge from processing the transaction. Manual intervention may be required. Contact Bridge if you haven't already been notified.                                                                    |
| `canceled`          | The transaction has been canceled and queued for return. Reasons may include falling below the minimum route threshold or AML/EFE rejection.                                                                             |

<Note>
  Please note that a drain will always progress from `funds_received` → `payment_submitted` → `payment_processed`. It can never go backwards.
