title: "Liquidation Address"
---

# **Introduction**

A “Liquidation Address” is a permanent payment route which ties a blockchain address to either a bank account or another blockchain address. When a customer sends crypto, such as USDC, to their liquidation address, the process differs based on the chosen payment rail. If the destination payment rail is `wire`, `sepa` or any of our supported chains, the funds are promptly sent upon receipt. However, for `ACH` payments, the transaction is queued and processed as part of our daily ACH batch submission, which occurs at 1:00 pm EST/EDT.

Read the [<u>Developer Fees</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/docs/adding-your-fees) section on how to set fees.

Please see the [<u>Stablecoins and Blockchains</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/docs/blockchains) page for what is supported, as well as any asset-specific requirements that may apply.

# **Examples**

## [**<u>Create a Liquidation Address</u>**](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/reference/post_customers-customerid-liquidation-addresses)** with a fiat destination**

### **Request**

Shell

```
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/customers/cust_alice/liquidation_addresses' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Api-Key: <Api-Key>' \
--header 'Idempotency-Key: <Unique Idempotency Key>' \
--data-raw '{
  "chain": "ethereum",
  "currency": "usdc",
  "external_account_id": "ea_alice_bofa"
  "destination_wire_message": "alice_wire_123"
  "destination_payment_rail": "wire",
  "destination_currency": "usd",
}'
```

This `destination_wire_message` has very strict rules around its format. You can have at most 3 lines (separated by `"\n"`), each line with a max length of 35 chars. If this standard is not met, the request will be rejected

### **Response**

JSON

```

  "id": "liq_alice_123",
  "chain": "ethereum",
  "external_account_id": "ea_alice_bofa",
  "currency": "usdc",
  "address": "0xc0ffee",

}
```

## [**<u>Create a Liquidation Address</u>**](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/reference/post_customers-customerid-liquidation-addresses)** with a **`SEPA`**destination** 

### **Request**

Shell

```
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/customers/cust_alice/liquidation_addresses' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Api-Key: <Api-Key>' \
--header 'Idempotency-Key: <Unique Idempotency Key>' \
--data-raw '{
  "chain": "ethereum",
  "currency": "usdc",
  "external_account_id": "ea_alice_sepa_bank"
  "destination_sepa_reference": "alice-sepa-123"
  "destination_payment_rail": "sepa",
  "destination_currency": "eur"
}'
```

This `destination_sepa_reference` has very strict rules around its format. If specified, it must be between `6` and `140` characters. The allowed characters are `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, spaces, ampersand (`&`), hyphen (`-`), full stop (`.`), and solidus (`/`). If this standard is not met, the request will be rejected

### **Response**

JSON

```
{
  "id": "liq_alice_123",
  "chain": "ethereum",
  "external_account_id": "ea_alice_sepa_bank",
  "currency": "usdc",
  "address": "0xc0ffee",
  "destination_sepa_reference": "alice-sepa-123",
  "destination_payment_rail": "sepa",
  "destination_currency": "eur",
  "created_at": "2023-11-22T21:31:30.515Z",
  "updated_at": "2023-11-22T21:31:30.515Z"
}
```

For memo-based blockchains, such as Stellar, a `blockchain_memo` will be provided as part of the response. This must be included in the crypto deposit memo. When you forget to include the memo, the liquidation will experience delays.

# **Minimum Amounts**

The following destination currencies require a minimum amount of funds to complete liquidation:

- USDT: minimum of \$20 USD
- All others: \$1

Any deposits below this amount will not be processed.

# **Transfers vs Liquidation Addresses**

An off-ramp transfer does mostly the same thing as a liquidation address: they both take in crypto and output fiat. However, there are a few tradeoffs to consider when deciding between the two products

- A transfer requires exact matching on the `from_address`
  - When a deposit is made to kick off a transfer, the sender of that deposit must be known before creating the transfer within Bridge.
  - This can be an issue when your customer is sending from a centralized exchange like Coinbase or Binance, where the sending address is not known ahead of time.
  - In these situations, a liquidation address is better, as the sender doesn't have to be specified in order for Bridge to orchestrate your customer's funds.
- A transfer requires exact matching on the `amount`
  - When a deposit is made to kick off a transfer, the amount of that deposit must be known before creating the transfer within Bridge. This amount needs to be exact.
  - Similar to the `from_address` issue, this could potentially be a problem from certain exchanges or systems that debit gas from the output amount.
  - In these situations, a liquidation address is also recommended.
