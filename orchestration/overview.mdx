Orchestration is the foundation of the Bridge platform. Our orchestration APIs let you **move money — fiat or stablecoins — from point A to point B**, in the format that best fits your use case.

| **API**                       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **Transfers**                 | **One-time fiat or stablecoin transfers.** Convert from a source currency (stablecoin or fiat) to a destination currency (stablecoin or fiat) - e.g. USDC to EURO, BTC to USD, USD to USDC, and more. Programatically support crypto on ramps, crypto off ramps, and crypto to crypto transfers.<br /><br />Transfers can originate from a customer deposit, a Bridge-managed wallet, or a prefunded account, and can be sent to either fiat or stablecoin destinations. |
| **Static Template Transfers** | **Reusable payment routes for recurring transfers.** A static template provides persistent deposit instructions your customers can use repeatedly, without generating new details each time.<br /><br />When funds are received, Bridge automatically matches the payment to the template and **creates a new transfer instance** — enabling fully automated, repeatable payment flows.                                                                                  |
| **Virtual Accounts**          | **Fiat deposit addresses** issued to your customers, allowing them to easily receive fiat transfers using shareable bank details (e.g. account and routing numbers). Each address is uniquely linked to a customer for accurate tracking and reconciliation.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Prefunded Accounts**        | **Preload funds** and use the balance to send instant fiat offramps without waiting for incoming deposits to clear.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Static Memos**              | **Reusable deposit memos for fiat-to-crypto flows**. Your users can send funds repeatedly using the same memo without regenerating instructions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Liquidation Address**       | **Link a blockchain address to a designated fiat or crypto destination.** When funds are received at the liquidation address, Bridge automatically forwards them to the mapped destination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
