title: "Create your first customer"
---

This guide walks you through onboarding your first customer using Bridge's API. Whether you want a fast start with a hosted KYC flow or prefer full control via API integration, this guide covers both options.

# Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A Bridge account with API access
- Your API key (keep this secure\!)
- A working development environment
- Basic familiarity with REST APIs and JSON

# What Is a Bridge Customer?

Bridge customers represent users of your business who can send and receive money. There are two types:

- **Individual customers**: Personal users with personal information
- **Business customers**: Companies with business information and beneficial owners

## Key Terms

- **KYC (Know Your Customer)**: Identity verification process required for compliance
- **Endorsements**: Approval for specific payment rails (USD, EUR, MXN)
- **Terms of Service**: Legal agreement customers must accept

Learn more about the customers api at [Customers](/customers/overview).

# Method 1: Using KYC Links (Quick Start - Recommended)

Bridge provides a **hosted onboarding flows** so you donâ€™t have to build your own KYC UI. This is the fastest way to onboard customers.

## Step 1: Create a KYC Link

Use the `/kyc_links` endpoint to generate links for TOS acceptance and KYC verification

```bash Request
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/kyc_links' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Api-Key: <API Key>' \
--header 'Idempotency-Key: <generate a uuid>' \
--data-raw '{
  "full_name": "John Doe",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com",
  "type": "individual"
}'
```

```json Response expandable
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "full_name": "John Doe",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com",
  "type": "individual", // or "business"
  "kyc_link": "https://bridge.withpersona.com/verify?",
  "tos_link": "https://dashboard.bridge.xyz/accept-terms-of-service?",
  "kyc_status": "not_started", // or "under_review", "incomplete", "approved" or "rejected"
  "rejection_reasons": [],
  "tos_status": "pending", // or "approved"
  "created_at": "2025-07-16T18:28:25.970Z",
  "customer_id": "customer_id",
  "persona_inquiry_type": "gov_id_db"
}
```

## Step 2: Share the Links with Your Customer

Guide the user through:

1. Visiting the `tos_link` and accepting terms of service
2. Completing identity verification via the `kyc_link`

This process typically takes less than a minute and updates automatically once complete.

# Method 2: Direct API Integration (More Control)

Prefer to control the onboarding UI? You can collect and submit customer data directly to Bridge.

## Step 1: Create an Individual Customer Using API

Create U.S. based customer:

```bash Request expandable
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/customers' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Api-Key: <API Key>' \
--header 'Idempotency-Key: <generate a uuid>' \
--data-raw '{
  "type": "individual",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "email": "email@example.com",
  "residential_address": {
    "street_line_1": "123 Main St",
    "city": "New York City",
    "subdivision": "New York",
    "postal_code": "10001",
    "country": "USA"
  },
  "birth_date": "2007-01-01",
  "signed_agreement_id": "d536a227-06d3-4de1-acd3-8b5131730480",
  "identifying_information": [
    {
      "type": "ssn",
      "issuing_country": "usa",
      "number": "xxx-xx-xxxx"
    },
    {
      "type": "drivers_license",
      "issuing_country": "usa",
      "number": "xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "image_front": "data:image/jpg;base64,...",
      "image_back": "data:image/jpg;base64,..."
    }
  ]
}
```

For business customers or international onboarding, see the [Customers](/customers/overview) documentation.

## Step 2: Customer Endorsements: Enabling Transacting

A customer endorsement activates a customer to use a specific payment rail. Most flows automatically request a "base" endorsement when creating a customer.

Endorsements represent an approval of a customer to onboard and transact with Bridge. To onboard a customer and enable them to take actions on Bridge, the customer must provide their KYC information and accept the terms of service for the required endorsement type.

## Checking Customer Endorsement Status

```bash Request expandable
curl --request GET \
     --url https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/customers/{customerID} \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```

<Check>
  Example of an approved customer
</Check>

```json Response expandable

{
 	id: '1',
  ...
  endorsements: [
    {
      name: 'base',
      status: 'approved',
      additionalRequirements: [],
      requirements: {
        complete: [
            "first_name",
            "last_name",
            "tax_identification_number",
            "email_address",
            "date_of_birth",
            "accepted_risk_region",
          	"address_of_residence",
						"terms_of_service_v1"
				],
        pending: [],
        missing: null,
        issues: [],
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

<Warning>
  Example of an incomplete customer

```json expandable
{
  "id": "cust_1",
  ...
  "endorsements": [
    {
      "name": "base",
      "status": "incomplete",
      "requirements": {
          "complete": [
            "first_name",
            "last_name",
            "tax_identification_number",
            "email_address",
            "date_of_birth",
            "accepted_risk_region",
            "address_of_residence"
          ],
          "pending": [],
          "missing": {
            "all_of": [
              "terms_of_service_v1",
              "sanctions_screen"
            ]
          },
          "issues": []
      },
    },
  ]
}
```
