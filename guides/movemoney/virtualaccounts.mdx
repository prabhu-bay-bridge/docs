title: "Onramp to stablecoins with virtual accounts"
---

# Overview

Bridge ****virtual accounts are permanent, reusable fiat deposit addresses**** that convert incoming fiat into crypto and deliver it to your specified destination (e.g. a wallet address).

They support multiple currencies and provide customers with local deposit details like account numbers and routing codes. For example, a USD virtual account gives your customer a U.S. account and routing number for ACH or wire transfers.

**Supported Payment Rails**

- **USD Virtual Accounts** - U.S. bank account and routing numbers issued in your customer’s name.
- **SEPA Virtual IBAN** - Euro-denominated IBANs for accepting SEPA payments.
- **MXN Virtual Accounts** - CLABE account numbers for receiving SPEI (Mexico) payments.

Developers use virtual accounts to simplify global payments, custody stablecoins (e.g. USDB), and enable programmable flows. A common pattern: create a virtual account for a customer, route funds into a Bridge wallet, and earn yield.

<Note>
  **Customers must be onboarded** and KYC/KYB-approved before creating virtual accounts.

# Step 1: Create a virtual account

Use the [Virtual Accounts](ref:virtual-accounts-1) API to provision permanent fiat deposit addresses for your customers. You define the `source` currency for the account and configure the `destination` to specify where Bridge should deliver the converted funds.

Bridge handles the fiat-to-crypto conversion and sends the funds on-chain automatically.

## Sharing Deposit Instructions

Once a Virtual Account is created, use the `source_deposit_instructions` object in the response to share the fiat deposit details with your customer. Funds sent to those details will be automatically converted and delivered to the crypto destination you specified.

---

# Step 2: Monitoring virtual account events

Once a Virtual Account is created, your customer can start receiving fiat payments using the provided deposit instructions.

Bridge automatically tracks the full lifecycle of each deposit—from the moment funds are received to the point they are delivered on-chain. Each event in this lifecycle is represented by a `VirtualAccountEvent`.

## Event Creation and Tracking

Whenever a deposit is received, Bridge generates a `VirtualAccountEvent` with a unique `id`. You can:

- Fetch historical events using the [Virtual Account Activity](ref:get_customers-customerid-virtual-accounts-virtualaccountid-history) API.
- Receive **real-time webhook notifications** when:
  - A new deposit is received.
  - The status of an event changes (e.g. funds delivered, refund issued).

Each `VirtualAccountEvent` includes detailed information about the deposit, source, status, and destination.

## Virtual account event types

Below are the different types of virtual account events you may receive. You can identify the type of each event by checking the `type` field in the virtual account event object.

### Payment Lifecycle

| Type                | Description                                                           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `funds_received`    | Bridge received funds via ACH or wire.                                |
| `payment_submitted` | Bridge submitted the crypto payment.                                  |
| `payment_processed` | Payment confirmed on-chain. Final state.                              |
| `funds_scheduled`   | (ACH only) Incoming funds are in transit with estimated arrival date. |
| `in_review`         | Transaction is under manual review.                                   |
| `refunded`          | Funds could not be delivered and were refunded to the sender.         |

### Other

| Type             | Description                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `account_update` | Virtual Account was updated (e.g. new destination address).   |
| `deactivation`   | Virtual Account was deactivated.                              |
| `reactivation`   | Virtual Account was reactivated.                              |
| `microdeposit`   | Microdeposit verification detected. Funds are never onramped. |

<Info>
  All transaction-triggered events include a `deposit_id` field. This id is unique for each transaction that Bridge receives through this Virtual Account and can be used to link separate events to the same source transaction.
