title: "Offramp wallet funds to an external account"
---

This guide walks you through how to offramp funds from a Bridge-managed wallet to an external fiat account (e.g. a customerâ€™s bank account) using the Transfers API.

# Prerequisites

Before you start:

- A Bridge wallet with sufficient balance
- A verified customer (via KYC or business onboarding)
- External account created

---

# Step 1: Create a transfer from a Bridge wallet to an external bank account

Use [Create a transfer](ref:post_transfers) endpoint to move funds from a Bridge wallet to a fiat destination.

**Request**

```curl
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/transfers' \
--header 'Api-Key: <API Key>' \
--header 'Idempotency-Key: <Unique Key>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "amount": "100.00",
  "on_behalf_of": "cust_12345", // id of the customer who owns the wallet and ext. account
  "source": {
    "payment_rail": "bridge_wallet",
    "currency": "usdb",
    "bridge_wallet_id": "wallet_abc123" // id of the bridge wallet with funds
  },
  "destination": {
    "payment_rail": "ach",
    "currency": "usd",
    "external_account_id": "ext_account_xyz789" // id of the customer bank account
  }
}'
```

# Step 2: Monitor transfer status

You can query the [Get a transfer](ref:get_transfers-transferid) endpoint or listen to webhook events to retrieve the transfer details:

**Request**

```curl
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/transfers/transfer_xyz' \
--header 'Api-Key: <API Key>' \
--header 'accept: application/json'
```

**Response**

```json
{
  "id": "transfer_xyz",
  "state": "payment_processed",
  "amount": "100.00",
  "source": { ... },
  "destination": {
    "payment_rail": "ach",
    "currency": "usd",
    "external_account_id": "ext_account_xyz789"
  },
  ...
}
```

Common states:

- `awaiting_funds`: waiting for source balance
- `payment_submitted`: funds handed off to banking partner
- `payment_processed`: funds delivered to external account
