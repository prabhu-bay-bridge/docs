# **Overview**

Although we donâ€™t send webhook events in the sandbox environment, you can still view the events that would have been sent. To do this, you can set up a webhook endpoint just as you would in production, and then query for events that would have been delivered.

# **Testing webhooks**

## **1. Set Up Webhook Endpoint**

To create a webhook endpoint, you can `POST` to `v0/webhooks` as you would in production with a payload like so:

```json
{
    "url": "https://example.com/api/webhooks/bridge_webhook_event_testing",
    "event_epoch": "beginning_of_time"
}
```

<Note>
  You should use a more accurate `event_epoch` as your event epoch in your integration.
</Note>

In a successful response, you should receive a payload like the following:

```json
{
    "id": "wep_tir8iiYS3khF4TqEe7jpKje",
    "url": "https://example.com/api/webhooks/bridge_webhook_event_testing",
    "status": "disabled",
    "public_key": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----<KEY>-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n",
    "created_at": "2025-02-11T00:42:08.581Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-02-11T00:42:08.806Z"
}
```

## **2. Activate the webhook endpoint**

To activate the webhook endpoint, you can send a `PUT` request to `v0/webhooks/{webhook\_id}` just as you would in production. The `webhook_id` is the same `id` returned from the response of the `POST` request from the previous step.

 To activate the endpoint, you set the status with a payload like so:

```bash
...
{
    "status": "active"
}
...
```

In a successful response, you should see a payload like the following:

```json
{
    "id": "wep_tir8iiYS3khF4TqEe7jpKje",
    "url": "https://example.com/api/webhooks/bridge_webhook_event_testing",
    "status": "active",
    "public_key": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----<KEY>-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n",
    "created_at": "2025-02-11T00:42:08.581Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-02-11T03:03:30.918Z"
}
```

## **3. View Webhook Events**

To view events that would have been sent to the webhook endpoint, you can send a `GET` request to `https://api.sandbox.bridge.xyz/v0/webhooks/{webhook_id}/events`. The `webhook_id` is the same as per the previous. No payload is required, but in sandbox you can pass in a category query parameter to specify which exact events you would like in the payload.

For example, to see card account specific events, you can `GET https://api.sandbox.bridge.xyz/v0/webhooks/{webhook_id}/events?category=card_account`. The response will have a format like so:

```json expandable
{
    "data": [
        {
            "api_version": "v0",
            "event_id": "wh_tn3ZFia7M5541nzLVJDtj8P",
            "event_sequence": 2,
            "event_category": "card_account",
