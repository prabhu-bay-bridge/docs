title: "Managing PINs"
---

# **Overview**

Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) are an important security control and help keep your user's funds safe and card program low-risk. By providing an easy to use PIN management flow you can keep your users safe and ensure that transactions are not blocked.

## **Security Considerations**

PINs are sensitive data, so we take special caution to never transmit directly through your servers

In order to address both security and regulatory concerns (PCI) all PIN operations are mediated via time-limited, single-use URLs surfaced in hosted frames.

# **PIN Management Operations**

As of date, Bridge only offers a single PIN management operation:

- **Update Card PIN: **Allows customers to securely set or change their card PIN. Note that they cannot view their PIN in this flow.

## **Updating a Card PIN**

To allow a customer to update their PIN you will need to request a signed URL from the Bridge API, and then use that URL to render an iframe in your application or a webview.

To do so, you should use the [<u>Create Card PIN Update URL</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/reference/post_customers-customerid-card-accounts-cardaccountid-pin)<u> [todo update link]</u> API to request a signed URL which your user can use to kick off a PIN editing session.

```bash
curl -x POST https\://<https://api.bridge.xyz/customers/>\<CUSTOMER_ID>/card_accounts/\<CARD_ACCOUNT_ID>/pin  
-H "Content-Type: application/json"  
 	-H "Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

You should then embed this URL via an iframe tag

```html
<iframe 
  src="https://secure.example.com/view-pin?token=abc123"
/>
```

## **Pin lifecycle events**

You can listen for events from the PIN management iframe to determine when operations are complete:

```javascript
if (window.addEventListener) {  
	window.addEventListener("message", function (event) {  
    	// Modify URL to match environment  
    	if (event.origin !== "\<BRIDGE_ORIGIN>") {  
        	return;  
}  
    	var statusCode = event.data;  
    	// Do something with the statusCode...  
	}, false);  
}
```

## **Styling the PIN edit form**

Bridge provides a default set of styles for the PIN edit form, which are designed to be legible and easy to use across a variety of locales. Custom styles which match the design of your application are also supported.
