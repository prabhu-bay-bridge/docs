Head over to [**dashboard.bridge.xyz**](https://dashboard.bridge.xyz/). Once logged in, click on the “API Keys” tab on the top menu bar and generate a new API key.

Bridge will make your **API key available only once**, so make sure to **immediately copy and save the key safely and securely**. \

Your key is used to authenticate into our APIs and is highly sensitive. If it ever gets compromised, you can immediately revoke key access from our dashboard and generate a new key.
