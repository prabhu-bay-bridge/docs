Create a USD or EUR account for your customer. Provide the bank instructions to them so that they can receive direct bank transfers and deposits. Funds deposited are converted to stablecoins and sent directly to your customerâ€™s wallet.

Now, link the wallet to a virtual account. Any fiat deposits into the account will be automatically converted to USDB and delivered to the wallet.
