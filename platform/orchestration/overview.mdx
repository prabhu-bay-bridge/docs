Orchestration is the foundation of the Bridge platform. Our orchestration APIs let you **move money — fiat or stablecoins — from point A to point B**, in the format that best fits your use case.

| [**Transfers**](/platform/orchestration/transfers/transfer)                                | **One-time fiat or stablecoin transfers.** Convert from a source currency (stablecoin or fiat) to a destination currency (stablecoin or fiat) — e.g. USDC → EUR, BTC → USD, USD → USDC. <br /><br />Programmatically support on-ramps, off-ramps, and crypto-to-crypto flows. Transfers can originate from a customer deposit, Bridge-managed wallet, or a prefunded account. | Use when you want to move funds between currencies or rails **one time or on demand** — especially for single-use or triggered transactions. |
| [**Static Template Transfers**](/platform/orchestration/transfers/static-templates)        | **Reusable payment instructions for recurring transfers**. <br /><br />A static template provides persistent deposit instructions your customers can use repeatedly. When funds are received, Bridge matches them to the template and creates a new transfer instance automatically.                                                                                          | Use when you expect **recurring or programmatic deposits** from the same source.                                                             |
| [**Virtual Accounts**](/get-started/guides/move-money/virtualaccounts)                     | **Fiat deposit addresses** issued to your customers, allowing them to receive fiat via traditional rails using shareable bank details (e.g., account and routing numbers). <br /><br />Each address is tied to a specific customer for reconciliation.                                                                                                                        | **Use when customers need a bank-like account number** to receive fiat payments from external parties.                                       |
| [**Prefunded Accounts**](/platform/orchestration/prefunded_accounts/prefunded_accounts)    | ****Preload funds to a Bridge-managed balance and use that balanceto send instant fiat offramps****  without waiting for deposit settlement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Use when speed is critical and you want to **guarantee fast offramps**.                                                                      |
| [**Liquidation Address**](/platform/orchestration/liquidation_address/liquidation_address) | **Link a blockchain address to a mapped fiat or crypto destination.** When funds arrive at this address, Bridge auto-forwards them to the final destination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Use when **converting or forwarding crypto automatically**.                                                                                  |
