A **Liquidation Address** is a permanent payment route which ties a blockchain address to either a fiat or blockchain address. When a customer sends crypto, such as USDC, to their liquidation address, Bridge will automatically send funds to the destination.

## **Point a liquidation address to an external bank account**

```bash Request expandable
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/customers/cust_alice/liquidation_addresses' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Api-Key: <Api-Key>' \
--header 'Idempotency-Key: <Unique Idempotency Key>' \
--data-raw '{
  "chain": "ethereum",
  "currency": "usdc",
  "external_account_id": "ea_alice_bofa"
  "destination_wire_message": "alice_wire_123"
  "destination_payment_rail": "wire",
  "destination_currency": "usd",
}'
```

```json Response expandable
{
  "id": "liq_alice_123",
  "chain": "ethereum",
  "external_account_id": "ea_alice_bofa",
  "currency": "usdc",
  "address": "0xc0ffee",
  "destination_wire_messaage": "alice_wire_123",
  "destination_payment_rail": "wire",
  "destination_currency": "usd",
  "created_at": "2023-11-22T21:31:30.515Z",
  "updated_at": "2023-11-22T21:31:30.515Z"
}
```

The response object contains the blockchain `address` of the liquidation address. Now anytime your customer receives funds on this address, Bridge will automatically convert it to USD and send a wire payment with the wire message.

## **Create a liquidation address with a crypto destination**

```bash Request expandable
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/customers/cust_alice/liquidation_addresses' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Api-Key: <Api-Key>' \
--header 'Idempotency-Key: <Unique Idempotency Key>' \
--data-raw '{
  "chain": "ethereum",
  "currency": "usdt",
  "destination_payment_rail": "polygon",
  "destination_currency": "usdc",
  "destination_address": "0xdeadbeef"
}'
```

```json Response expandable
{
  "id": "liq_alice_456",
  "chain": "ethereum",
  "address": "0xc0ffee",
  "currency": "usdt",
  "destination_payment_rail": "polygon",
  "destination_currency": "usdc",
  "destination_address": "0xdeadbeef",
  "created_at": "2023-11-22T21:31:30.515Z",
  "updated_at": "2023-11-22T21:31:30.515Z"
}
```

### Memo based blockchains

<Warning>
  Don't forget the blockchain memo.
</Warning>

For memo-based blockchains, such as Stellar, a `blockchain_memo` will be provided as part of the response. This must be included in the crypto deposit memo.

```json Response expandable
{
  "id": "liq_alice_123",
  "chain": "stellar",
  "external_account_id": "ea_alice_bofa",
  "currency": "usdc",
  "address": "GDUY7JBRIDGESTELLARLIQUIDATIONADDRESS",
  "blockchain_memo": "12345",
  "created_at": "2023-11-22T21:31:30.515Z",
  "updated_at": "2023-11-22T21:31:30.515Z"
}
```

## Create a liquidation address with a custom developer fee

[Setting a custom developer fee](/fees/devfees) overrides the default Liquidation Address developer fee for a given Liquidation Address upon creation.

```bash Request expandable
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/customers/cust_alice/liquidation_addresses' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Api-Key: <Api-Key>' \
--header 'Idempotency-Key: <Unique Idempotency Key>' \
--data-raw '{
  "chain": "ethereum",
  "currency": "usdc",
  "external_account_id": "ea_alice_bofa"
  "destination_wire_message": "alice_wire_123"
  "destination_payment_rail": "wire",
  "destination_currency": "usd",
  "custom_developer_fee_percent": "10.2",
}'
```

## **Static Template Transfers vs Liquidation Addresses**

Static template transfers are similar to liquidation address in that they are both saved payment routes. The key difference is that a liquidation address is a permanent blockchain address, whereas static template transfer rely on the deposit message to route funds. For customers, it's more intuitive to use a unique blockchain address.
