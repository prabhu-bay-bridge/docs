## **Introduction**

Bridge allows developers to collect **custom, per-transaction fees** from their users. These developer fees are automatically withheld from the customer’s transaction amount and set aside in a ledger reserved for you.

Fees are settled and **paid out monthly** on the 5th of each month to your configured external account. You can use the [Configure a fee External Account](/api-reference/developers/configure-a-fee-external-account) API to configure the external account you want to get paid out in.

<Note>
  **Fees are optional.** Leaving the developer_fee or developer_fee_percent field blank is treated as a fee of 0.0.
</Note>

## **Transfers**

### **Transfers with fixed amounts**

For transfers with a fixed amount, Bridge supports developer fees expressed in USD (as a fixed decimal amount). You can set `developer_fee` in the [<u>API request</u>](/api-reference/transfers/create-a-transfer)

```bash expandable
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/transfers' \
--header 'Api-Key: <API Key>' \
--header 'Idempotency-Key: <Unique Idempotency Key>' \
--data-raw '{
  "amount": "50.0",
  "on_behalf_of": "cust_alice",
  "developer_fee": "0.5", # developer fee
  "source": {
    "payment_rail": "ach",
    "currency": "usd",
    "external_account_id": "external_account_123",
  },
  "destination": {
    "payment_rail": "ethereum",
    "currency": "usdc",
    "to_address": "0xdeadbeef",
  },
}'
```

In this example:

- Customer sends: \$50.00
- Developer fee withheld: \$0.50
- Amount delivered to destination: \$49.50

**Examples**

| **Input amount** | **Developer Fee** | **Net to Destination** | **Result** |
| :--------------- | :---------------- | :--------------------- | :--------- |
| 99.99            | 0.99              | 99.00                  | ✅ valid    |
| 21.20            | 5.19              | 16.01                  | ✅ valid    |
| 5.00             | 5.00              | 0                      | ❌ rejected |
| 5.00             | 5.01              | -                      | ❌ rejected |

**Validations**

- Currency: `developer_fee` is denominated in USD, not a percentage.
- Per-Transaction: You specify the fee with each request — allowing full control.
- Must have sufficient minimum: You cannot deduct more than the total transaction amount. After we deduct the fee, there must be enough for the transaction minimum. Refer [<u>Transaction Minimums</u>](/platform/orchestration/fees-and-mins/mins).
- Precision: Up to 2 decimal places (e.g., 10.99 is valid, 10.999 is not).
- Destination amount: Always equal to amount - developer_fee.
- The fee is only valid on transactions where funds are transferred by Bridge (not to Bridge)

### **Transfers with flexible amounts**

When you're creating Transfers with `flexible_amount` enabled, only percentage-based fees are supported via the `developer_fee_percent` field.

```bash expandable
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/transfers' \
--header 'Api-Key: <API Key>' \
--header 'Idempotency-Key: <Unique Idempotency Key>' \
--data-raw '{
  "on_behalf_of": "cust_alice",
  "source": {
    "payment_rail": "ach",
    "currency": "usd",
  },
  "destination": {
    "payment_rail": "ethereum",
    "currency": "usdc",
    "to_address": "0xdeadbeef",
  },
  "developer_fee_percent": "2.0", // A 2% developer fee
  "features": {
    "flexible_amount": true,
  }
}'
```

For example:

- Customer sends: \$100.00
- Developer fee withheld: \$2
- Amount delivered to destination: \$98

## **Virtual Accounts**

When using Virtual Accounts, the exact amount of incoming funds is not known ahead of time. As a result, developer fees must be specified as a percentage, using the `developer_fee_percent` field.

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/customers/cust_alice/virtual_accounts' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Api-Key: <Api-Key>' \
--header 'Idempotency-Key: <Unique Idempotency Key>' \
--data-raw '{
  "source": {
    "currency": "usd",
  },
  "destination": {
    "payment_rail": "ethereum",
    "currency": "usdc",
    "address": "0xDEADBEEF"
  },
  "developer_fee_percent": "1.0" // 1%.
}'
```

**Validations**

- The fee is always in the source currency.
- The fee must be less than the customer's transaction amount.
- The fee has maximum 5 digits of precision, i.e. `0.00119` is allowed, but `0.0000001` is not
- The fee is optional. If `developer_fee_percent` is blank, then it’s equivalent to the fee being set to `0.0`
- The fee is only valid on transactions where funds are transferred by Bridge (not to Bridge)

## **Liquidation Address**

### **Global default developer fee percent**

To set a global fee that applies to all Liquidation Addresses, use the [<u>developer fees API</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/reference/post_developer-fees).

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/developer/fees' \
--header 'Api-Key: <API Key>' \
--header 'Idempotency-Key: <Unique Idempotency Key>' \
--data-raw '{
  "default_liquidation_address_fee_percent": 0.5,
}'
```

In this example:

- If a user deposits \$50.00, they receive \$49.75
- \$0.25 (0.5%) is credited to the developer's fee ledger

### **Per address developer fee percent**

To override the default for a specific address, include `custom_developer_fee_percent` when [<u>creating a Liquidation Address</u>](/api-reference/developers/update-the-configured-fees).

```bash expandable
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/customers/cust_alice/liquidation_addresses' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Api-Key: <Api-Key>' \
--header 'Idempotency-Key: <Unique Idempotency Key>' \
--data-raw '{
  "chain": "ethereum",
  "currency": "usdc",
  "external_account_id": "ea_alice_bofa"
  "destination_wire_message": "alice_wire_123"
  "destination_payment_rail": "wire",
  "destination_currency": "usd",
  "custom_developer_fee_percent": "10.2",
  "created_at": "2023-11-22T21:31:30.515Z",
  "updated_at": "2023-11-22T21:31:30.515Z"
}'
```

<Info>
  custom_developer_fee_percent must be a positive decimal (e.g., 10.2 means 10.2%).
