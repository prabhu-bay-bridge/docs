Static Memos are long-lived deposit instructions that accept fiat funds through wire and ACH push and send funds to the configured destination wallet. The same Static Memo can receive both wires and ACH pushes interchangeably.

<Warning>
  **Don't forget the**`deposit_message !`

  For Static Memos, it is very important that the customer includes the `deposit_message` when they send funds. Failure to include the `deposit_message` will result in a significant delay in processing or a return of the funds.
</Warning>

## Create a Static Memo

```bash Request expandable
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/customers/cust_alice/static_memos' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Api-Key: <Api-Key>' \
--header 'Idempotency-Key: <Unique Idempotency Key>' \
--data-raw '{
  "source": {
    "currency": "usd",
    "payment_rail": "wire",
  },
  "destination": {
    "payment_rail": "ethereum",
    "currency": "usdc",
    "address": "0xDEADBEEF"
  },
 "developer_fee_percent": "1.0" // 1%. This is optional and defaults to 0 if not set
}'
```

The response will contain deposit instructions for your customer to send funds to Bridge.

```json Response expandable
{
  "id": "static_memo_alice_123",
  "status": "activated",
  "developer_fee_percent": "1.0",
  "customer_id": "cust_alice",
  "source_deposit_instructions": {
    "bank_name": "Lead Bank",
    "bank_address": "1801 Main St., Kansas City, MO 64108",

  },
  "destination": {
    "payment_rail": "ethereum",
    "currency": "usdc",
    "address": "0xdeadbeef"
  }
}
```

### **Optional Blockchain memo**

For memo-based blockchains such as Stellar, you may include an optional `blockchain_memo` in the destination field. Bridge will forward the memo when sending crypto funds.

```bash Request
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/customers/cust_alice/static_memos' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Api-Key: <Api-Key>' \
--header 'Idempotency-Key: <Unique Idempotency Key>' \
--data-raw '{
  "source": {
    "currency": "usd",
    "payment_rail": "wire"
  },
  "destination": {
    "payment_rail": "stellar",
    "currency": "usdc",
    "address": "STELLARADDRESS",
    "blockchain_memo": "STELLARBLOCKCHAINMEMO"
  }
}'
```

## **Listing Static Memos for a Customer**

      }
    } 
  ]
}
```

## **Update a Static Memo**

Update the destination details for an existing Static Memo. Future transactions will use the updated destination details. All fields in this request are optional. Updating a Static Memo will also create an `account_update` event in the history for that account.

```bash Request
curl --location --request PUT 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/customers/cust_alice/static_memos/sm_123' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Api-Key: <Api-Key>' \
  --data-raw '{
	  "destination": {
	    "payment_rail": "ethereum",
	    "currency": "usdt",
	    "address": "0xDEADBEEF"
	  },
    "developer_fee_percent": "2.5", // 2.5%, omitting will not change the existing dev fee percent
  }'
```

## **History of Static Memo Activity**

This endpoint provide a history of activity for Static Memos such incoming fiat funds received and outgoing payments on chain. See [<u>List History of Static Memo activity</u>](/api-reference/static-memos/static-memo-activity) for more information about the types of events returned from these endpoints.

## **Static Memo Events**

### **Event types**

| **Event**           | **Description**                                                                                  |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `funds_received`    | Bridge has received funds and is preparing to move them on the customer’s behalf.                |
| `payment_submitted` | Bridge has sent the payment and is awaiting confirmation (usually takes a few minutes on-chain). |
| `payment_processed` | Funds have arrived at the destination. Final state.                                              |
| `in_review`         | Temporary review state. Bridge may reach out for additional info.                                |
| `refund`            | Bridge couldn't complete the transfer and is returning funds to the sender.                      |
| `account_update`    | Triggered when a Virtual Account's destination details (e.g. address, currency) are updated.     |

Please note that a transaction will always progress from `funds_received` → `payment_submitted` → `payment_processed`. It can never go backwards.

All transaction-triggered events include a `deposit_id` field. This id is unique for each transaction that Bridge receives through this Static Memo and can be used to link separate events to the same source transaction.

<Warning>
  Static memos do not support microdeposit or challenge deposit verifications.

### **Event breakdown**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Funds received">
    Information about a fiat deposit received. The `funds_received` event amount always matches the full amount that the customer sent before any fees are deducted. We also provide any source information we have about the sender of a deposit. The information available differs by source payment rail:

    - **ACH:** description, payment rail
    - **Wire:** beneficiary name, routing number, bank name, IMAD, OMAD (deprecated), payment rail

  <Accordion title="Payment submitted">
    Information about any funds sent on chain using the deposit instructions. This event is created when the funds are sent on chain. The `payment_submitted` event amount is the funds sent to the destination after all fees are taken out and includes a breakdown of the amount of each customer-facing fee. Some information such as `destination_tx_hash` may not be available immediately after the `payment_submitted` event is created but will be populated later when the transaction is confirmed on chain.

    For convenience, the source deposit information is included in this event as well if available.

    Information about any funds sent on chain using the deposit instructions. This event is created when the funds are confirmed on chain. The `payment_processed` event amount is the funds sent to the destination after all fees are taken out and includes a breakdown of the amount of each fee. The`destination_tx_hash`will always be populated for these events. This is final event in the onramp payment lifecycle and the best event to determine when a payment is fully complete.
