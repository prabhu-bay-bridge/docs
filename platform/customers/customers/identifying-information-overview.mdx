Please reference our latest API documentation [here](/api-reference/customers/create-a-customer) for an in-depth look at entire request payload.

**General rules:**\
All business and individual customers (including associated persons) verified by Bridge must satisfy our `identifying_information` requirements. These requirements consist of providing a valid Tax ID document and Government Photo ID.

### Individuals and Associated Persons

**National/Tax Identification requirement:** You must include at least one valid identification number to satisfy the tax id requirement. Please reference [this list](/platform/customers/compliance/individuals#individual-identification-numbers-by-country) for acceptable types for individuals. You can also optionally provide a `passport` or `national_id` number (image optional) and we will accept this as a valid Tax ID for all countries **except for the US**.

**For US-based Individuals:** only an `ssn` or `itin` is valid.

**Government Photo ID requirement:** All non-US individuals must include a valid government issued photo ID. The following types are acceptable: `drivers_license`, `matriculate_id`, `military_id`, `permanent_residency_id`, `state_or_provincial_id`, `visa`, `passport`, `national_id`.

_Please contact support if you have a use case for a different government issued photo ID that you'd like Bridge to consider adding._

The `number` of this document is optional but the `image_front` is required.

**For US-based individuals:** Although optional, we strongly recommend providing a photo ID to streamline their onboarding (higher likelihood of automatic approval), minimize RFIs, and reduce transaction reviews/delays.

**Other Considerations:** For non-US individuals, a `passport` or `national_id` can be used to satisfy both the individuals tax id and government photo id requirement if you provide both the `number` and `image_front` of the document.

### Businesses

**Tax Identification requirement:** You must include at least one valid tax identification number to satisfy the Tax ID requirement. Please reference [this list](/platform/customers/compliance/businesses/identification) for acceptable types for businesses.

_Sole proprietorships can submit any valid individual Tax ID number for their same respective country._
