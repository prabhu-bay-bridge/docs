There will be situations where Bridge may require additional customer information for a given customer.

For example, we offer the option to create restricted US customers who do not need to provide a government ID when using the Customers endpoint. However, these restricted customers are limited to transactions of \$10,000 each, and a total of \$100,000 over a 30-day period. To increase these limits, the additional information can be collected either via a new hosted URL or via a PUT request.

## **KYC Links**

A KYC Link can be requested for an existing customer to provide additional KYC information required by certain products or services offered by Bridge.

To request a KYC Link:

```bash Request
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/customers/cust_123/kyc_link' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Api-Key: <API Key>'
```

```json Response
{
  "url": "https://bridge.withpersona.com/verify?inquiry-template-id=itmpl_NtIXpb9AbEYCPxGo5iRbc9d2&reference-id=75d2f259-6810-4cde-a9b9-83eca42b0ebf"
}
```

To enable an existing customer to use the `SEPA`/`Euro` services, users may be required to provide `proof of address`depending on where their government identification is from . An additional parameter, `endorsement=sepa`, can be included to request a KYC link with this specific step enabled in the flow.

```bash Request
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/customers/cust_123/kyc_link?endorsement=sepa' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Api-Key: <API Key>'
```

Please reference our [<u>KYC Link API</u>](/platform/customers/customers/kyclinks) for existing customers for more details.

## **Acceptance of a new ToS version for an existing customer**

Bridge launched a new version on `4/14/2024`. Its acceptance is required for using the SEPA/Euro services. For an existing customer, a `GET` request can be issued to this endpoint to retrieve a ToS acceptance link to accept the new version.

```bash Request
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/customers/cust_123/tos_acceptance_link' \
--header 'Api-Key: <API Key>'
```

```json Response
{
  "url": "https://dashboard.bridge.xyz/accept-terms-of-service?email=sage%40blick-mayer.example&t=74ea7c13-2b52-5073-bd12-6879f92b88dd"
}
```

Use this `url` to guide the customer towards Terms of Service acceptance. You can embed this URL in an iFrame or display in a new browser window. For iFrame and WebView implementations, we recommend listening to the `postMessage` event for the `signedAgreementId`. Moreover, you can pass a `redirect_uri` query parameter that will redirect the TOS page back to your application with a `signed_agreement_id` as a query parameter.
