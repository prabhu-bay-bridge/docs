## Customers API Overview

The **Customers API** and **KYC Links API** allow you to register your end users with Bridge, enabling seamless and compliant movement of stablecoins or fiat between your users' wallets or bank accounts.

Bridge handles all **KYC (Know Your Customer)** and **KYB (Know Your Business)** verification steps, allowing you to initiate secure transfers with confidence that your users meet all applicable compliance requirements.

---

### Key Concepts

- **Customers**: Represent end users of your platform.
- **KYC/KYB**: Mandatory identity and business verification handled by Bridge.
- **Endorsements**: Used to verify if a customer is eligible to transact on specific rails or services.

### Customer Registration

To register a new customer, use either the **Customers API** or the **KYC Links API**. Upon registration:

- Customers must **agree to Bridge's Terms of Service**.
- You must provide **basic identity information** such as:
  - Full name
  - Email address
  - Government-issued identifiers (e.g., SSN for individuals, EIN/TIN for businesses)

Bridge will validate this information to approve the customer for transactions. If additional information is needed, Bridge will return precise requirements for completion of the KYC/KYB process.

ðŸ“˜ **See Also**: [KYC Requirements](/platform/customers/customers/kyclinks) for a detailed list of required fields and document types.

### Accepting Terms of Service Without KYC

In cases where you only need users to accept Bridgeâ€™s Terms of Service **without initiating KYC/KYB**, use the [**Terms of Service API**](/platform/customers/customers/tos). This is useful for scenarios where full onboarding isn't immediately required but legal acceptance of terms is necessary.

### Checking Customer Eligibility (Endorsements)

Use [**Endorsements**](/platform/customers/customers/endorsements) to verify whether a specific customer is eligible to interact with a particular service, rail, or transaction type.

This step ensures the customer has passed all necessary checks before you attempt transfers, deposits, or withdrawals via Bridge.
