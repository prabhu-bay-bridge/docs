title: "(Beta) Indexed deposits webhook"
description: "Receive webhooks for quick detection of crypto deposits."
mode: "custom"
---

The Indexed deposits webhook alerts you of customer deposits as we detect them on chain. This is useful for use cases that require information about the first possible appearance of a deposit on chain, whether or not it has been finalized.

**When to Use**\
Use this webhook if your application benefits from knowing about a deposit _as soon as it appears on chain_, even before it’s finalized. Ideal for UX that wants to pre-notify users of inbound funds, or to start monitoring for large incoming payments.

## Important disclaimer: risk of loss\!

<Danger>
  A transaction that is `detected` here may not ultimately be `finalized` due to chain reorganization. **<u>Please understand your risk and liability before utilizing this webhook.</u>**
</Danger>

In the case of a chain reorganization, it is possible to receive multiple `detected` webhook events for a transaction occurring in multiple branches. I.e. transaction with hash `X` may be seen on a block with hash `A` and again on a block with hash `B`. In such a case, two `detected` webhook events will be sent.

For the purpose of tracking deposits uniquely, be sure to take into account the `block_hash`, `tx_hash`,  an`log_or_instruction_index`.

**Be aware that this information is provided to help developers track the status of a deposit on the blockchain, not the state of a transaction within the Bridge system.** Even though an indexed deposit is detected or finalized , the transaction may still be incomplete. Use caution when utilizing the information from this webhook.

## Applicable deposits

| Chain      | Assets    |
| :--------- | :-------- |
| Base       | USDC EURC |
| Ethereum   | USDC USDT |
| Polygon    | USDC      |
| Solana     | USDC      |
| Tron       | USDT      |
| Worldchain | USDC      |

## Deposit states

Indexed deposits are categorized in one of two states:

- `detected` - The deposit has been detected on chain, but has not achieved finality. It is possible that this deposit may not be incorporated into the canonical chain
- `finalized` - The deposit has achieved finality, indicating a higher degree of confidence that it will be incorporated into the canonical chain.\
  Payload Structure

**NOTE**: As development continues on this feature, the structure of this payload is likely to change.
