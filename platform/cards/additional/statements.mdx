## **Overview**

In order to offer a card program to your customers, you will need to generate statements which you send to them _at least_ monthly.

In order to do so, Bridge provides a single API for automatically generating statements in PDF form.

## **Generating a statement**

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/customers/<customerID>/card_accounts/<cardAccountID>/statements/<period>.pdf \
     --header 'accept: application/pdf'
```
