Bridge uses API keys to authenticate your requests. You can generate them from the [dashboard](http://dashboard.bridge.xyz/app/keys) .

**‚ö†Ô∏è API keys are shown only once** at the time of creation. Be sure to copy and store them securely ‚Äî they cannot be retrieved later.

### üîë How Authentication Works

- Pass your API key in the Api-Key header using HTTP Basic Auth.
- No username or password is required ‚Äî just the API key.
- All requests must be made over HTTPS; requests over plain HTTP are rejected.
- Invalid or missing keys will return a 401 Unauthorized.

> ‚ùóÔ∏è Keep your API keys secure. They grant full access to your account and should never be shared publicly or within internal tools like Slack or dashboards.

### Sandbox Environment

- In the sandbox, API keys are scoped to individual developer accounts.
- Keys generated in sandbox are not visible to teammates, even if production keys are shared across the org.

### Example Request

```shell
curl --location --request GET 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v1/customers' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Api-Key: <your-api-key>'
```
