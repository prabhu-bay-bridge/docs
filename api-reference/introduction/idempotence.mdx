### Idempotency

All `POST` APIs in Bridge require [idempotency](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Idempotent) to guarantee safe retries and prevent duplicate operations. You must include an `Idempotency-Key` header with a unique value for each request.

This ensures that if a request is retried (due to network errors, client timeouts, or unexpected failures), Bridge can detect the duplication and return the same response, without performing the operation again.

> Do not include an Idempotency-Key with GET, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE requests. These methods are naturally idempotent and do not require this header.

### How It Works

- Include a unique Idempotency-Key (typically a UUID) in the request header of every POST.
- Bridge guarantees idempotent behavior for 24 hours after the initial request. During this window, any subsequent request with the same Idempotency-Key will return the original response â€” with no side effects or duplicated operations.
  - For example, if a request to create a Customer or a Transfer fails or times out, you can safely retry it using the same key to ensure that only one object is ever created.
- After the 24-hour window expires, reusing the same Idempotency-Key will result in a 422 Unprocessable Entity error.

### Best Practices

- Use a UUID for each new request.
- Store the UUID in your database to track request state.
- Reuse the same UUID when retrying a failed request.

### Example

```shell
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v1/customers' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Api-Key: <your-api-key>' \
--header 'Idempotency-Key: <generated-uuid>' \
--data-raw '{
