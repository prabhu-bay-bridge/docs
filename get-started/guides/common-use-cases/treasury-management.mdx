title: "Treasury management"

Manage your customer’s treasury funds with USDB – a Bridge-issued stablecoin backed 1:1 by US dollars. USDB earns treasury yield, and that yield is shared with you. Create a virtual account and wallet to custody treasury funds. Fiat deposits into the virtual account are converted to stablecoins and held in the customer’s wallet. Use the Transfers API to enable customers to pay vendors.
