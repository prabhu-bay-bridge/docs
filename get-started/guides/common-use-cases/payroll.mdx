title: "Running payroll"
---

To enable your customer (the “employer”) to pay employees or contractors in stablecoins globally, you need to create a **wallet** and **virtual account** for the employer and a **wallet** for each employee. Once the employer deposits payroll funds into their virtual account, Bridge converts the fiat to stablecoins and securely holds the funds in the employer’s wallet. To process payroll, use the Transfers API to send funds from the employer’s wallet to each employee’s wallet.

## Step 3: Create a wallet for the employer

Create a prefunded wallet to securely hold the employer’s payroll funds. A prefunded wallet is a specialized wallet that allows you to maintain and disburse funds on behalf of the employer until it’s time to process payroll.

## Step 4: Create a virtual account

Create a USD or EUR account for the employer. Provide them with the bank instructions so that they can deposit payroll funds. Funds deposited are converted to stablecoins and sent directly to the employer’s wallet.

## Step 5: Move funds from the employer's wallet to the employee's wallet using the Transfers API

Use the Transfers API to move funds from the employer’s prefunded wallet to the employee’s wallet. Simply provide the source and destination wallet addresses and specify the amount. You will need to call the API for each employee.
