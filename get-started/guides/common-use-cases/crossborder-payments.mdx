title: "Cross-border payments"
---

Enable customers to make cross-border payments to suppliers by creating a virtual account and wallet for each customer and an external account that stores a supplier’s bank details. Fiat deposits into the virtual account are converted to stablecoins and sent to the customer’s wallet. Use the Transfers API to convert the stablecoins to local currency and pay each supplier.
