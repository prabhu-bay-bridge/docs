To enable your customer (the “sender”) to send fiat or stablecoins to recipients globally, you need to create a **virtual account** for the sender and a **wallet** for the recipient. Once the sender deposits funds into their virtual account, Bridge converts the fiat to stablecoins and delivers the stablecoins to the recipient’s wallet
