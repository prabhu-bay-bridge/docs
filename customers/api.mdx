title: "Customers API"
---

The Customers API enables you to directly pass the KYC information to Bridge. This endpoint enables you to control the UI independently and handle all of the back and forth with customers, regardless of whether they are individuals or businesses.

To determine whether a customer is able to use the platform, Bridge monitors the customer's `kyc_status` and the `status` of each requested [<u>endorsement</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/docs/endorsements), e.g.`base` endorsement for access to US rails.

If Bridge is able to validate the information, the customer will receive KYC approval and be granted the requested endorsement(s) to use Bridge's platform.

If certain information was invalid or missing, the customer object will return the appropriate KYC status, endorsement status, and [<u>endorsement requirements</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/docs/endorsements#endorsement-requirements).

After obtaining a `signed_agreement_id` (details here: [<u>Terms of Service</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/docs/terms-of-service)), you can now use the [<u>Customers API</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/docs/customers-1) to create customers as follows.

Note: `proof_of_address_document` may be required for individual customers from `European Economic Area (EEA)`, or customers who wish to use SEPA/Euro services offered by Bridge, if conflicting location signals are detected. Please refer to [<u>SEPA/Euro Transactions</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/docs/sepa-euro-transactions) page for details.

For international customers, submit an [<u>ISO 3166-1 alpha-3</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3) country code and an [<u>ISO 3166-2 subdivision code</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:AR) (minus the country prefix) for the state. So for the above example, `GB-MAN` is the code, but just `MAN` is submitted.

# **Customer status**

Upon customer creation, Bridge will review the submitted customer information and return statuses for both overall KYC (`kyc_status`) as well as a status for each requested endorsement (e.g. `base`, the endorsement for US rails, will have its own `status`). Bridge recommends using **both** `kyc_status`and endorsement `status` to determine the customer's ability to use the Bridge platform.

## **KYC status**

Upon customer creation, Bridge will review all KYCs for the customer and return a `status` field that denotes the KYC status (as applicable) for the user (example KYC statuses include `not_started`, `active`, or `rejected`). The average decision time for KYC is typically less than one minute. If a manual review is required for KYC, the decision may take until next business day. KYB reviews typically happen same business day, up to next business day.

```json Response expandable
// 201 CREATED
{
  "id": "cust_john_uuid",
  "first_name": "John",
  "kyc_status": "not_started",
  // ...
  "requirements_due": [
    "external_account" // Customer needs to register their bank account with Bridge
  ],
  "created_at": "Thu, 04 May 2023 15:40:40.832827000 UTC +00:00",
  "updated_at": "Thu, 04 May 2023 15:40:40.832827000 UTC +00:00"
}
```

While KYC generally works quickly, there are edge cases that are important to account for. Here are a few examples of how the KYC status of a customer could progress:

- `not_started` -\> `active`
  - This is our happy path for individual customers. The customer information was submitted, and quickly passed via automated checks within seconds.
- `not_started` -\> `under_review` -\> `approved/rejected`
  - All business customers and some individual customers may require the Bridge Compliance team to do due diligence of vetting customers manually before the reach a terminal status.
- `not_started` -\> `rejected`

![db44208-Screenshot_2024-02-02_at_12.42.46_PM.png](/images/db44208-Screenshot_2024-02-02_at_12.42.46_PM.png)

## **KYC rejection**

Sometimes, your customer could immediately move from not_started to rejected and skip under_review entirely. The primary reason this happens is when the tax identification number is entered incorrectly. Without a valid tax identification number, Bridge is unable to verify any of the other details you have submitted for your customer (birth date, address, name, or business details).

In this scenario, the customer starts off `not_started`, but after attempting to verify submitted information, there was an issue detected with the submission. It is possible to move directly to `rejected` and skip `under_review` entirely. In the `rejected` scenario, fetching the customer via `[GET /customers/:id](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/reference/get_customers-customerid)` would result in something like this:

```json expandable
{
  "id": "d99a4ee8-03a8-48a6-9cbf-7746a3ce1050",
  "email": "john@doe.com",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "status": "rejected",
  "type": "individual",
  "created_at": "2024-02-19T17:16:20.561Z",
  "website_url": null,
  "persona_idv_link": "...",
  "tos_link": "...",
  "tos_complete": false,
  "persona_inquiry_type": "gov_id_db",
  "rejection_reasons": [
    {
      "developer_reason": "Identity cannot be verified agains third-party databases",
      "reason": "Your information could not be verified",
      "created_at": "2024-02-19T19:01:59.529Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

You can see that the customer's KYC status is `rejected` and that there are two fields shared with rejection reasons:

- `developer_reason` is meant to be used by developers for **internal purposes only.** This field can contain sensitive information intended for only the developer and is provided to help with troubleshooting potential issues or protecting against potential abuse.
- `reason` can be shared by a developer directly with their customers.

For reference, see our page on [<u>Rejection Reasons</u>](/customers/rejection_reasons) for `developer_reason` and `reason` mappings for KYC rejection reasons.

## **Updating Customers**

Customer information can be updated at `PUT /customers/:id` . This endpoint accepts the same shape of data as the creation endpoint.

Notes:

- Even if information was submitted in the first attempt and has not changed, it must still be submitted in the update.
  - Bridge currently supports partial updates (e.g., not including all fields in the request) only the following parameters are included: `endorsements, residential_address, physical_address, verified_proof_of_address_at, documents` (with purpose = proof_of_address)
- Updating the customer object won't clear their rejection reasons from earlier attempts, but that won't prevent them passing KYC.
