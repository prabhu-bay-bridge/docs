Customers represent users of your business. By registering your customers with Bridge through the [Customers API](/customers/api) or [KYC Links API](/customers/kyclinks), you can enable seamless transfers of stablecoins or fiat currencies from or to your customer's wallets or bank accounts. All KYC and KYB checks are handled by Bridge so you can safely move funds, knowing that Bridge has properly vetted your users in compliance with legal requirements.

When you register a new customer with Bridge, they must agree to our terms of service, and we must collect key information such as name and email, along with unique identifiers such as SSN or EIN/TIN. Please see [full KYC Requirements](/customers/kyclinks) for details. This information allows Bridge to properly KYC/KYB and approve the customer before initiating any transactions with Bridge. If and when needed, we will further pass you precise details on what additional information we need from your users to complete KYC/KYB.

Alternatively, you can use [Terms of Service API](/customers/tos) to allow your customers to (re)accept Bridge's terms of service (ToS) without attempting KYC/KYB.

You can use [Endorsements](/customers/endorsements) to check a particular customer's ability to transact with different rails and services.
