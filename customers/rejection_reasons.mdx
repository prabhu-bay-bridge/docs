title: "Rejection Reasons"
---

If [<u>Customers API</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/docs/customers-api#kyc-rejection) and [<u>KYC Links</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/docs/kyc-links#immediate-rejection) return that the customer's KYC status isÂ `rejected`, there are two fields shared with rejection reasons:

- `developer_reason` is meant to be used by developers for **internal purposes only.** This field can contain sensitive information intended for only the developer and is provided to help with troubleshooting potential issues or protecting against potential abuse.
- `reason` can be shared by a developer directly with their customers.

| **developer_reason**                                      | **reason**                                                |
