When interacting with Bridge‚Äôs APIs, it's important to understand how we handle **rounding, fees, and fractional cent precision** to ensure your payments are processed smoothly and your customer receives the expected amount.

---

## Key Policies

- **Whole cent enforcement**\
  Bridge only processes amounts that can be expressed in **whole U.S. cents**.\
  Even if the stablecoin supports more than two decimal places, Bridge will **truncate** the amount to the nearest cent.
- **Fractional Cents Are Discarded**\
  Any fractional cent (e.g., `$100.119999`) will be **ignored**, not processed or refunded.
- **Rounding Ensures Sufficient Balance**
  - Bridge will round fractional cent values in such a way to ensure that there will always be sufficient balance available to process your transaction.
  - Bridge will always round in such a way to guarantee at least the minimum amount of fees that are owed to all parties, whether they be our developers or to Bridge.

### Example Calculation

Let‚Äôs say you want to offramp **\$100,100.119999 USDT** with a **10 bps developer fee (0.1%)**:

1. **Bridge truncates to whole cents**:\
   Note that USDT, like many other stablecoins, has 6 digits of precision. However, because Bridge only supports whole cents, we will first truncate this amount down to \$100,100.11.\
   `$100,100.119999 ‚Üí rounded down to $100,100.11`
2. **Bridge calculates developer fee**:\
   `0.1% of $100,100.11 = $100.10011 ‚Üí rounded up to $100.11`
3. **Customer receives**:\
   `$100,100.11 - $100.11 = $100,000.00`

Therefore, the amount that Bridge will send to the destination is \$100,000.00.

## Working backwards from desired output

If you want your customer to receive a **clean, round-dollar output**, use this formula:

`Input Amount = Output Amount / 0.999 `

Then **round up** to the nearest cent to ensure fees are covered.

<Note>
  These examples assume **no developer fee** and only standard Bridge exchange fees.
