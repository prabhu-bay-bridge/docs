Bridge's [<u>Webhooks API</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/reference/get_webhooks) lets developers manage webhook endpoints that are subscribed to webhook events for real-time updates instead of relying on API polling for a faster, more efficient, and better overall experience. Webhook endpoints require you to provide a `url` with the https scheme and a valid X.509 certificate. When your endpoint is created, a `PKI public key` in `PEM` format will be assigned to it and shared with you. Refer to [<u>Webhook Event Signature Verification</u>](/api-concepts/webhooks/signature) for details on how to verify the authenticity of incoming events.

When your endpoint is active, Bridge will deliver events with `POST` with the `application/json` content type. The endpoint should return a 200 status to Bridge as quickly as possible to avoid timeouts and retries on the Bridge side.

# **Implementation Flow**

A typical flow to implement Bridge webhooks within your application may like the following

1. Make a [<u>POST request to /webhooks</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/reference/post_webhooks) to create your endpoint in the `disabled` state.
2. Implement your application's logic for [<u>Webhook Event Signature Verification</u>](/api-concepts/webhooks/signature).
3. [<u>Get upcoming webhook events</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/reference/get_webhooks-webhookid-events) and [<u>send events</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/reference/post_webhooks-webhookid-send) to test the logic for receiving events from bridge. You can [<u>view event delivery logs</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/reference/get_webhooks-webhookid-logs) to debug any issues
4. After verifying your webhook functionality, enable it using [<u>PUT /webhooks</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/reference/put_webhooks-webhookid)

# **Webhook States**

The webhook status refers to the current state of a webhook. There are several possible states that a webhook can be in, including:

- `disabled` - This is the initial state of all newly created webhooks. Events will not automatically be delivered to the endpoint in this state. We recommend testing the webhook from this state using (see [<u>POST /send documentation</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/reference/post_webhooks-webhookid-send)). You can update the webhook to `active` using [<u>PUT /webhooks</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/reference/put_webhooks-webhookid). Webhooks must be disabled in order to change their URL
- `active` - Bridge will automatically deliver events to your webhook. Automatic delivery of events can be paused by updating the webhook to `disabled` using [<u>PUT /webhooks</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/reference/put_webhooks-webhookid)
- `deleted`- This state is only visible as the result of a [<u>DELETE /webhooks</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/reference/delete_webhooks-webhookid) request. This state is not considered a valid status input of [<u>PUT /webhooks</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/reference/put_webhooks-webhookid). Webhooks in this state will no longer be accessible from subsequent API requests.
