title: "Webhook Event Signature Verification"
mode: "wide"

For each event delivery, Bridge will include a webhook signature header in the HTTP request for event authenticity verification

- The header name is`X-Webhook-Signature` ;
- The header value format is `t=<timestamp>,v0=<base64 encoded signature>` , where the timestamp is in milliseconds;

To verify the signature, follow these steps:

1. Parse the signature header to extract the `timestamp` and `base64 encoded signature`
2. Join `timestamp` with the `raw http request body data` with a dot (`.`), and generate a `SHA256` digest;
3. Perform a strict base64 decoding on the `based64 encoded signature` to get the `decoded signature`;
4. Verify the signature using the per-endpoint `public key`, `digest` (from Step 2), and `decoded signature` (from Step 3

<Warning>
  **To avoid replay attacks**

  Bridge advises the receiving endpoint to disregard events that are older than a few minutes, e.g. 10 minutes, and return a 400 status to request retries. For each event delivery retry, Bridge generates a new timestamp.
