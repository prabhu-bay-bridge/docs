## 🇺🇸 **US External Bank Accounts**

### Beneficiary Address Requirements

To ensure addresses meet banking requirements and avoid transaction issues, Bridge applies the following validation rules:

1. **Required Fields**\
   Street Line 1, City, Postal Code, and Country are mandatory.\
   If the country includes states or provinces, State is also required.
2. **Format Restrictions**\
   No PO Boxes: Terms like “PO Box” are not allowed in Street Line 1 or 2.\
   No PMBs: “PMB” is not allowed in Street Line 1 or 2.
3. **U.S. Address Requirements**\
   U.S. addresses must include a street number in Street Line 1 (e.g., "123 Main St").
4. **Character Limits**\
   Street Line 1: 3–35 characters\
   Street Line 2: Maximum of 35 characters\
   Each formatted address line sent to the bank must not exceed 35 characters (bank imposed restrictions)
5. **Formatting**\
   Bridge formats the address into three lines before submission:\
   Line 1: Street Line 1\
   Line 2: Street Line 2\
   Line 3: City, State, Postal Code (and Country if not U.S.)

If **Line 3 exceeds 35 characters**, Bridge automatically shifts words from Line 3 upward into Line 2 (if space allows). If the **country name doesn't fit**, it's abbreviated using a 3-letter ISO-like code (e.g., `"Korea"` → `"Kor"`).
