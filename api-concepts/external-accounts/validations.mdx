# **US External Bank Accounts**

## **Beneficiary Address Validation**

To ensure addresses meet banking requirements and avoid transaction issues, Bridge applies the following validation rules:

1. **Required Fields**\
   Street Line 1, City, Postal Code, and Country are mandatory.\
   If the country includes states or provinces, State is also required.
2. **Format Restrictions**\
   No PO Boxes: Terms like “PO Box” are not allowed in Street Line 1 or 2.\
   No PMBs: “PMB” is not allowed in Street Line 1 or 2.
3. **U.S. Address Requirements**\
   U.S. addresses must include a street number in Street Line 1 (e.g., "123 Main St").
4. **Character Limits**\
   Street Line 1: 3–35 characters\
   Street Line 2: Maximum of 35 characters\
   Each formatted address line sent to the bank must not exceed 35 characters (bank imposed restrictions)
5. Beneficiary Address Validation\
   Bridge formats the address into three lines before submission:\
   Line 1: Street Line 1\
   Line 2: Street Line 2\
   Line 3: City, State, Postal Code (and Country if not U.S.)

**Examples**:\
San Francisco, CA 94105\
London, England SE10 9NF, United Kingdom

If Line 3 exceeds 35 characters, Bridge automatically attempts to accept the address by shifting leading words upward into line 2, if space allows. The original word order is always preserved. If the country name does not fit on Line 3, we abbreviate it using a three-letter code (e.g., “Korea” → “Kor”)
