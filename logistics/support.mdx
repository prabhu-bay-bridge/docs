We will set up a shared Slack or Discord channels with your team. When customer issues arise, it's generally easiest to work through them together in these forums.

For instance, if we receive a returned payments (because the bank account and/or routing number are incorrect), we will reach out in Slack and ask your team how you want to handle. Next steps could include: (1) retrying the payment, (2) updating the account information, or (3) returning funds to the Destination account.

Your team or your customers can also reach out directly to Bridge using email at [<u>support@bridge.xyz</u>](mailto:support@bridge.xyz).
