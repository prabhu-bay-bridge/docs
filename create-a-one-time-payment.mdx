This guide will walk you through sending a one-time payment using Bridge's Transfer API.

## Transfer API

The Transfer API enable conversion between fiat and crypto across supported currencies and rails. There are three primary transfer types:

- **Fiat → Crypto (aka onramps)**: Convert traditional fiat currency to cryptocurrency
- **Crypto → Crypto**: Exchange between different cryptocurrencies
- **Crypto → Fiat (aka offramps)**: Convert cryptocurrency to traditional fiat currency

Here are the key concepts to a transfer:

- **Source**: Origin of funds (Bridge wallet, customer crypto wallet, bank account)
- **Destination**: Endpoint for funds transfer
- **On Behalf Of**: Customer identifier for compliance
- **Amount**: Transfer amount (can be flexible)

### Transfer Flow

## Step 1: Create a transfer

Let's create a transfer for an onramp from a USD ACH deposit to a USDC Ethereum address.

```bash Request expandable
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/transfers' \
--header 'Api-Key: <API Key>' \
--header 'Idempotency-Key: <Unique Idempotency Key>' \
--data-raw '{
  "on_behalf_of": "cust_alice",
  "source": {
    "payment_rail": "ach_push",
    "currency": "usd",
  },
  "destination": {
    "payment_rail": "ethereum",
    "currency": "usdc",
    "to_address": "0xdeadbeef",
  },
  "features": {
		"flexible_amount": true // allows for any deposit amount
  }
}'
```

```json Response expandable
{
  "id": "transfer_123",
  "state": "awaiting_funds",
  "on_behalf_of": "cust_alice",
  "source": {
    "payment_rail": "ach_push",
    "currency": "usd"
  },
  "destination": {
    "payment_rail": "ethereum",
    "currency": "usdc",
    "to_address": "0xdeadbeef"
  },
  "source_deposit_instructions": {
    "payment_rails": ["ach_push","wire"],
    "currency": "usd",
    "deposit_message": "BRGEXAMPLEMEMO",
		"currency": "usd",
    "bank_beneficiary_name": "Test Beneficiary",
    "bank_routing_number": "123456789",
    "bank_account_number": "987654321",
    "bank_name": "Test Bank"
  },
 "features": {
    "flexible_amount": true
  },
  "created_at": "2023-05-05T19:39:14.316Z",
  "updated_at": "2023-05-05T19:39:15.231Z"
}
```

You can share the source deposit instructions with your customer. Your customer will then need to initiate an ACH deposit with:

- the destination routing number: `987654321`
- the destination account number: `987654321`
- with the a deposit message as:  `BRGEXAMPLEMEMO`

Once Bridge receives these funds, we'll look for the deposit message to find the payment.

## Step 2: Monitor Transfer Status

When Bridge receives the deposit, we'll transition the transfer state to `funds_received`. The transfer status when it's delivered is `payment_processed`. You can pull the transfer status from the API or listen to webhooks to watch the transfer transition.

View the full breakdown of transfer states [here](/orchestration/transfer/states).

### Fetching Transfers status via API

You can use the [Get a transfer](/api-reference/transfers/get-a-transfer) endpoint to fetch the latest Transfer status.

```bash Request expandable
curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.bridge.xyz/v0/transfer_123' \
     --header 'accept: application/json'
```

### Advanced: Monitoring using webhooks

You can set up webhooks to receive real-time notifications about transfer status changes. See [guide](/setting-up-webhooks) for more details on setting up webhooks.

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Instructions**: Provide customers with clear, step-by-step deposit instructions, including deposit messages
2. **Error Handling**: Plan for various failure scenarios and customer communication
3. **Testing**: Always test with small amounts before processing larger transfers

## Next Steps

After successfully creating your first transfer:

1. **Implement Webhook Processing**: Set up comprehensive webhook handling for all transfer events
2. **Customer Communication**: Build flows to notify customers of transfer status changes
3. **Error Recovery**: Implement processes to handle failed transfers
