Bridge Issuance allows you to access a Bridge stablecoin (“USDB”) or create your own stablecoin (“Custom Stablecoin”). This allows you to earn rewards by simply switching to Bridge Stablecoins using Bridge APIs.

Custom Stablecoins and USDB are issued and managed by Bridge. They are always backed 1:1 by the equivalent value of US dollars. Bridge issued stablecoins can be exchanged to and from most stablecoins or fiat using Bridge Orchestration APIs (transfers, liquidation addresses and virtual accounts).

## **Benefits**

There are several benefits to Bridge Stablecoins.

- **Rewards**: Funds held in stablecoins will earn rewards on balances.
- **Counterparty risk**: When Bridge issues a stablecoin, we can ensure your funds are uniquely managed and protected.
- **Hidden Fees**: There are no hidden fees such as minting or burning fees.
- **Fungible Dollar**: You can convert to Bridge Stablecoins using fiat or other stablecoins and transfer out of Bridge Stablecoins to fiat or other stablecoins easily.

## **How it Works**

1. You send us fiat or crypto using Bridge APIs and we send you a Bridge Stablecoin.
2. We manage the Bridge Stablecoin reserves in a segregated bank account and custody account for treasuries.
3. We send you a share of the earnings every month.

## **Blockchain Support**

Bridge Stablecoins are supported on a wide variety of chains (EVM and Solana) and we are adding additional chains based on demand.

**Live:** Solana, Base, Ethereum\
**Coming soon: **Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum

## **Requirements**

- All holders of Bridge Stablecoins must be associated with a KYC’d Bridge customer.
- You must use Bridge orchestration to onramp and offramp into USDB.
- Bridge Stablecoins are currently not available to EU residents (end users).

## **Distributing Rewards**

At the end of each month, Bridge will distribute rewards directly to a wallet (defined by you). This is a distribution/marketing fee to you for bringing the purchaser of the stablecoins to Bridge. Rewards will be minted as new tokens and sent to a wallet of your choice, once a month.

## **USDB v.s. Custom Stablecoins**

For most developers, USDB is the best choice because it’s simpler to get started - you don’t have to worry about liquidity management, which is complicated.

There are some cases where a custom stablecoin (“xUSD”) may be more suitable and the table below shows the differences between the options.

AUM thresholds for custom stablecoins are higher – we don’t have a minimum AUM requirement to access USDB.
