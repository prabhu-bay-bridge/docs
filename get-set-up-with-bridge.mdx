## Step 1: Create a Bridge account

Head over to [dashboard.bridge.xyz](https://dashboard.bridge.xyz) and create your free developer account. You can use the Bridge dashboard to manage your payments using a UI.

## Step 2: Create your API keys

Once logged in, click on the "API Keys" tab on the top menu bar and generate a new API key.

  Safely store your API keys

Bridge will make your **API key available only once**, so make sure to **immediately copy and save the key safely and securely**. Your key is used to authenticate into our APIs and is highly sensitive. If it ever gets compromised, you can immediately revoke key access from our dashboard and generate a new key.
