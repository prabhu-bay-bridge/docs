title: "First & Third Party Payment Support"
mode: "wide"
---

Bridge supports both first-party and third-party payments for customers:

- **First-party payments** involve moving funds on behalf of the same legal entity — for example, a business converting USD to USDC for its own treasury.
- **Third-party payments** involve sending or receiving funds on behalf of another party — such as a platform disbursing wages to a worker, or collecting payments from consumers on behalf of a merchant.

For example, with Bridge:

- A business can pay a vendor in fiat, even if the original funds are in stablecoins.
- A platform can collect fiat from a merchant and deliver stablecoins to a consumer.
- A payroll provider can send stablecoins or fiat wages on behalf of multiple employers.
- Peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers between individuals are supported, subject to applicable limits.

<Note>
  **Note: Third-party payments are currentlynot available for U.S. customers residing in Texas (TX) or Pennsylvania (PA)** . We’re actively working to enable this functionality in those states.

Bridge may, at its discretion, request additional information or documentation to support a third-party payment.
