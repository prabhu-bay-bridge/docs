<Update label="07/20/2025" description>
  **Handling Proof of Address Requests**

  We will be more consistently requesting <u>proof of address</u> when we detect conflicting location signals in a user's KYC/KYB.

  If using the API, you can tell if a customer needs to submit proof of address by looking at the endorsements section of a customer response, where the requirement will show up as missing

  ```json
  {
    "endorsements": [
      {
        "name": "base",
        "status": "incomplete",
        "requirements": {
  					...
            "missing": {
              "all_of": [  
                "proof_of_address",  
                ...  
              ]
            },
            ...
        },
      },
  ```

  To submit a proof of address document via API, include `documents` in your customer put/post request body, with an entry where the purpose is `proof_of_address`

  2. `created_at`**added to VirtualAccount and StaticMemo**

  Timestamp fields are now included to help with auditing and sorting. Refer API reference at [<u>Get a Virtual Account</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/reference/get_customers-customerid-virtual-accounts-virtualaccountid).

  3.`source_deposit_instructions.payment_rails` added to `StaticMemo`

  Includes the source details in the static memo response (supported rails right now are ACH & wire). Refer API reference at [<u>Get a Static Memo</u>](https://apidocs.bridge.xyz/reference/get_customers-customerid-static-memos-staticmemoid).
