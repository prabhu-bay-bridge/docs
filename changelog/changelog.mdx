<Update label="07/20/2025" description>
  **Handling Proof of Address Requests**

  We will be more consistently requesting <u>proof of address</u> when we detect conflicting location signals in a user's KYC/KYB.

  If using the API, you can tell if a customer needs to submit proof of address by looking at the endorsements section of a customer response, where the requirement will show up as missing

  ```json
  {
    "endorsements": [
      {
        "name": "base",
        "status": "incomplete",
        "requirements": {
  					...
            "missing": {
              "all_of": [  
                "proof_of_address",  
                ...  
              ]
            },
            ...
        },
      },
  ```

  To submit a proof of address document via API, include `documents` in your customer put/post request body, with an entry where the purpose is `proof_of_address`

  **Use Your Bridge Wallet to Automate Returns**

  You can now use a Bridge Wallet to **seamlessly fund fiat returns.**

  Bridge’s Transfer API already lets you return ACH, Wire, or SEPA deposits in cases of recalls, rejections, or refunds. Now, you can use a Bridge Wallet to **fund those returns directly**—no need to wait for a fresh deposit to initiate a payout.

  - Pre-fund your wallet at any time
  - Return funds instantly when needed
  - Simplify your flows

<Update label="07/15/2025">
  **Additions to LiquidationAddress, VirtualAccount, and StaticMemo Fields**

  We have added the below fields to Bridge endpoints.

  1.`customer_id` added to `LiquidationAddress`

  You can now identify which customer owns a liquidation address. Refer API reference at [<u>Get a liquidation address</u>](/api-reference/liquidation-addresses/get-a-liquidation-address).

  2. `created_at`**added to VirtualAccount and StaticMemo**

  Timestamp fields are now included to help with auditing and sorting. Refer API reference at [<u>Get a Virtual Account</u>](/api-reference/virtual-accounts/get-a-virtual-account).

  3.`source_deposit_instructions.payment_rails` added to `StaticMemo`

  Includes the source details in the static memo response (supported rails right now are ACH & wire). Refer API reference at [<u>Get a Static Memo</u>](/api-reference/static-memos/get-a-static-memo).

  4.`destination_payment_rail`**now included in history records**

  The `StaticMemo` and `VirtualAccount` objects returned in history endpoints now show the `destination_payment_rail` (e.g. USD.USDC.polygon) once the payment completes successfully.

  Refer API reference at [<u>Virtual Account Activity</u>](/api-reference/virtual-accounts/virtual-account-activity) and [<u>Static Memo Activity</u>](/api-reference/static-memos/static-memo-activity)
